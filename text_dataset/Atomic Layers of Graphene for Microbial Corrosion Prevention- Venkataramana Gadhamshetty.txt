ABSTRACT: Graphene is a promising material
for many
biointerface applications in engineering, medical, and life-
science domains. Here, we explore the protection ability of
graphene atomic layers to metals exposed to aggressive sulfate-
reducing bacteria implicated in corrosion. Although the
graphene layers on copper (Cu) surfaces did not prevent the
bacterial attachment and bioﬁlm growth,
they eﬀectively
restricted the biogenic sulﬁde attack. Interestingly, single-
layered graphene (SLG) worsened the biogenic sulﬁde attack by
5-fold compared to bare Cu. In contrast, multilayered graphene
(MLG) on Cu restricted the attack by 10-fold and 1.4-fold
compared to SLG-Cu and bare Cu, respectively. We combined
experimental and computational studies to discern the anomalous behavior of SLG-Cu compared to MLG-Cu. We also report
that MLG on Ni oﬀers superior protection ability compared to SLG. Finally, we demonstrate the eﬀect of defects, including
double vacancy defects and grain boundaries on the protection ability of atomic graphene layers.

M icroorganisms cause nearly 20% of corrosion

failures, resulting in ∼$2.5 billion of the global
corrosion costs annually.1 For instance, biofouling,
biogenic sulﬁde attack, or microbiologically inﬂuenced
corrosion (MIC)2 issues caused by sulfate-reducing bacteria
(SRB) require the US Navy to spend ∼$1 billion every year.
SRB is a major bacterial group that directly or indirectly
challenges the structural
integrity of metals by producing
highly reactive and corrosive agents including sulﬁde species.
Compared to planktonic (ﬂoating) cells, their sessile counter-
parts (bioﬁlms) are 1000 times more resistant to biocides and
induce 100-fold greater corrosion. Although polymer coatings
based on polyurethane, epoxy, and polyamides can protect
metals from abiotic corrosion,3 they are susceptible to
biodegradation under aqueous conditions.

Owing to the quantum conﬁnement eﬀects at the nanoscale,
atomic graphene layers have been found to display many
outstanding properties that may be useful in protecting metals
exposed to aggressive biological environments. Graphene oﬀers
high mechanical strength (1100 GPa), impermeability,4,5 and
hydrophobicity.1 It has shown oxidation resistance to metals6
in ambient conditions7 as well as to aggressive chlorides,8
boiling seawater,9 acids,10 oxidizers,11 and humidity.12 Also,
atomic layers of graphene can protect nanostructured metals

from oxidation.13,14 For instance, transparent electrodes based
on a copper nanowire−graphene core−shell nanostructure
showed better thermal oxidation and chemical stability due to
the tight encapsulation of
the copper nanowire within
graphene shells. Another study showed that the direct 3D
coating of the graphene layer on interlacing copper nanosilks
network electrodes achieved high transparency and robust
antioxidant ability.15 Graphene can be combined with
functional groups as well as other 2D materials to create
heterostructures that are more resistant in biological environ-
ments. Thus, graphene has been considered to control in vitro/
in vivo behavior of many biological systems.16,17

Despite many pending challenges, chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) remains the most eﬀective method for manufacturing
large-area graphene.18,19 Here, we prepared

protective coatings on copper (Cu) exposed to anoxic sulfate-
rich biological environment simulated by a genetically tractable
Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 (DA-G20) strain. We studied MIC
of Cu corrosion as it
is a prevalent problem in many
engineering applications (e.g., corrosion of canisters used to
store nuclear wastes). Although Cu is stable under abiotic
conditions,20 SRB renders it susceptible to corrosion even
under ambient conditions.21 We assessed the quality of as-
grown single-layered graphene (SLG) and multilayered
graphene (MLG) coatings using microscopy and spectroscopy
techniques. We then used electrochemical methods to quantify
the degree of biogenic sulﬁde attack and biotic corrosion. We
found that atomic graphene layers neither restrict the growth
of DA-G20 cells nor the bioﬁlm. However, SLG on Cu
worsens the biogenic sulﬁde attack by 5-fold compared to bare
Cu. In contrast, the MLG forms an impermeable barrier to
protect the Cu surface from aggressive metabolites released by
the bioﬁlm. The MLG-Cu restricts the biogenic sulﬁde attack
by 10-fold and 1.4-fold compared to SLG and bare Cu,
respectively. We combined experimental and computational
studies to explain the eﬀect of structural properties of atomic
graphene layers on the biogenic sulﬁde attack. We also studied
the graphene layers on nickel substrates to discern their
protection behavior on other metals. Finally, we studied the
eﬀect of double vacancy defects and grain boundaries on the
protection ability of atomic graphene layers.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We synthesized SLG (∼1 layer) and MLG (∼8 layers) on 25
μm thick Cu substrates using low-pressure CVD techniques, as
described in our previous studies.22 In typical experiments,
methane (35 sccm) was delivered to the CVD chamber at
1000 °C and 500 mTorr. MLG was grown using a CH4/H2
mixture (10:30 sccm) at atmospheric pressure and 940 °C for
20 min. The graphene ﬁlms on Cu formed continuous sheets
in both SLG and MLG samples, as shown in Figure 1a,c,
respectively. The wrinkles across the Cu grain boundaries
corroborate the continuity of graphene ﬁlms. For further
characterization by optical imaging, Raman, and TEM analysis,
we transferred the ﬁlms from Cu foil onto SiO2/Si substrates
using a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-assisted meth-
od.23 The SLG sample reﬂected a consistent spread of light
blue tint on the light pink background of SiO2/Si (Figure 1b);
the MLG sample displayed a varying ﬁlm thickness, evident
from patches of
light blue within the large bright blue
background (Figure 1d). The Raman spectra for both samples
exhibited a G band and 2D band corresponding to the E2g
vibration mode at 1590 and 2665 cm−1, respectively (Figure
1e,f). The G/2D ratio for SLG and MLG was in the range of
0.5−0.6 and 1.7−1.9,
indicating single-layered and multi-
layered graphene, respectively. The D band in SLG and MLG
indicates the presence of defects and disorders.24,25 The TEM
images conﬁrmed one and eight atomic layers in SLG and
MLG, respectively (Figure 1g). Finally, the water contact angle
values for Cu, SLG-Cu, and MLG-Cu were 82.3° ± 2.0°, 92.2°
± 2.0°, and 94.2° ± 3.0°, respectively (Figure 1h−j), which
agree with previous studies.26

An immediate application of as-grown graphene atomic
layers is their use as a coating to protect underlying Cu surfaces
from an aggressive biogenic sulﬁde attack. We found that the
atomic graphene layers neither restricted the cell attachment
nor bioﬁlm growth, as shown in the SEM images (Figure 2a).
Upon a prolonged exposure for 8 days, the cells grew into a

on both the layered surfaces. This ﬁnding comes as a surprise
in light of the recent studies on antimicrobial properties of
CVD-graphene/Cu, speciﬁcally to Escherichia coli (E. coli) and
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus).27 In a subsequent study,
Novoselov and co-workers conﬁrmed that graphene materials

compared to Cu (−760 mV vs Ag/AgCl) as well as SLG-Cu
(−776 mV vs Ag/AgCl). The Rp value for MLG-Cu on day 3
was 7 times and 36 times higher compared to those of bare Cu
and SLG-Cu, respectively (Figure S2). The MLG-Cu sup-
pressed the Cu dissolution by 95% when compared to bare Cu.
We used a computational study based on density functional
theory to understand the worsened biotic corrosion behavior
of SLG-Cu compared to bare Cu and MLG-Cu. The inherent
structural defects in graphene29 layers (depicted as one- to six-
atom vacancies, V1 to V6 in Figure 4a) constitute potential

neither stimulate nor inhibit the growth of E. coli and S.
aureus.28 The artifact on the antimicrobial properties of
graphene is due to the presence of impurities in graphene.28
As expected, bare Cu experienced a signiﬁcant biogenic
sulﬁde attack, as conﬁrmed by the XRD peaks of copper
sulﬁdes (Cu2S) (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Surpris-
ingly, SLG-Cu experienced a higher degree of microbial attack,
conﬁrmed by more intense sulﬁde peaks (Figure S1). We used
ASTM-G1 protocols to remove the corrosion deposits and
microbial debris from the Cu surfaces to visualize the degree of
attack on the actual Cu surface with optical image analysis. As
shown in Figure 2c,
the SLG-Cu developed a rough
topography, darker shades of corrosion products, and the
localized pitting (black colored pits shown by red arrows).
SLG-Cu inherited a pronounced signature of MIC compared
to bare Cu (Figure 2c). In contrast, the MLG-Cu surface
remained intact with visible Cu grain boundaries (Figures
2b,c). These results suggest
that SLG-Cu aggravated the
microbial attack while MLG-Cu oﬀers outstanding protection
in biological environments.

Next, we used electrochemical methods to quantify the
biotic corrosion behavior of bare and coated Cu surfaces
(Figure 3). SLG-Cu experienced an accelerated degree of Cu

pathways for the corrosive species (HS−, H+, OH−, O2, and
H2O) to permeate onto the underlying Cu surfaces. We used
Cu (111) (6 layers of Cu atoms) modiﬁed with perfect
graphene (1−6 layers) in the simulations. We evaluated the
work function (WF) of SLG-Cu and MLG-Cu as a function of
Cu−graphene distance (d), as depicted in Figure 4b. The
computed value of WF (eV) for graphene-Cu (∼4.5 eV) is
lower than that of bare Cu(111) (∼5.1 eV), and these values
agree well with that of the previous report.30

Adsorbed graphene on Cu results in the formation of an
the Cu−graphene interface. Our
electric double layer at
experimental results based on the electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) analysis suggest that SLG displays 100-fold
higher double-layer capacitance (Cdl) compared to MLG
(Figure 4c). As shown in Figure 4b, Cu−graphene displays the
least value of WF when the number of graphene layers ranges
from 1 to 3. Although the WF for SLG reduced only slightly
from ∼5.1 to ∼4.9 eV at larger separation distances (d = 6 Å),

from the downward trend (more
negative values) of the open-circuit potential (OCP) compared
to bare Cu (Figure 3a); this downward trend was sustained for
the entire exposure period. The lower polarization resistance
(Rp) values of SLG-Cu corroborate its worsened corrosion
behavior (Figure S2). For instance, the Rp for SLG-Cu on day
3 was 80% lower than bare Cu. Finally, the corrosion rates of
SLG-Cu on day 0 and day 8 were ∼22-fold and 5-fold higher
than bare Cu, respectively (Figure 3b). In contrast, MLG
layers on Cu oﬀered biotic corrosion resistance, as evident
from their positive OCP values (−715 mV vs Ag/AgCl)

it dropped to ∼4.6 eV at d = ∼ 3.3 Å and to ∼4.2 eV at d < 3.3
Å. For smaller values of d, WF decreases rapidly due to
graphene−Cu chemical interactions as well as Pauli repulsion
between the occupied graphene and Cu orbitals, pushing the
electronic cloud into Cu, making Cu prone to corrosion. These
interaction eﬀects are largest for SLG-Cu, and such eﬀects
diminish with the increasing number of graphene layers,
becoming negligible for MLG-Cu (>4 L). Thus, the fewer the
number of graphene layers the higher the electrical double
layer strength, lower the WF,31,32 more electropositive the Cu,

As seen in eqs 1−4, the lower the charge transfer resistance
(Rct) of HS− on to the Cu surface, the higher will be the
galvanic corrosion rates. The Rct for SLG-Cu was at minimum
19-fold and 10-fold lower than for MLG-Cu and bare Cu,
respectively, based on the EEC analysis (Figure S3) of the
lower Rct to Cu
Nyquist data (Figure 4d). The eﬀect of
oxidation for SLG-Cu compared to bare Cu and MLG-Cu can
be qualitatively observed in the Nyquist plots for day 0 (Figure
3c) and day 8 (Figure 3d), as indicated by the lowest
semicircle diameter. Our results agree well with those from
previous reports on the 10-fold higher electron mobility in
SLG (23.3 × 104 cm2/V·s) vs MLG (2.0 × 104 cm2/V·s).37,38
Moreover, the metabolites (HS−, H+) that increase over time
to dope the defects in graphene, as reﬂected in the
act
increase of values of Cdl and the corresponding
temporal
decrease in Rct to corrosion for both of the protective layer
cases (Figure 4c,d), while according to density functional
theory (DFT) calculations, the WF of Cu is lowered for any
number of graphene layers making Cu more electropositive,
electron tunneling between Cu and corrosive metabolites
adsorbed on the outermost layer may be hindered for MLG-
Cu. This would eﬀectively slow down the reactions in eqs 1
and 2 and diminish the corrosion in MLG-Cu.

Next, we investigated the eﬀect of atomic-scale vacancy
defects and grain boundaries in graphene layers on their
protection ability to underlying metals. We studied the eﬀect of

After establishing that SLG-Cu displays higher Cdl and lower
WF, we describe that SLG-Cu donates electrons from the Cu
oxidation and shifts the balance in eq 1 below toward the
chemisorption of HS− at the cathodic sites (defects).20 Biotic
corrosion begins with the attachment of DA-G20 cells on the
Cu surfaces and subsequent growth into bioﬁlm, as established
in prior sections (Figure 2a). This bioﬁlm releases corrosive
metabolites that are strongly adsorbed onto inherent defects
(Figure 4a),33−35 which serve as cathodic sites for the galvanic
corrosion of the underlying Cu surface. The excessive ﬂow of
biogenic HS− to the cathodic sites is compensated by a rapid
supply of electrons from the Cu oxidation.36 The chemisorbed
species further attack Cu to form Cu2S deposits (Figure S1),
promoting a biogenic sulﬁde attack (eq 2).

double-vacancy defects on the WF behavior of Cu(111)
substrates modiﬁed with the atomic graphene layer (Figure 5).
Typically, such defects locally change the WF of SLG-Cu,
which in turn could aﬀect
the local corrosion rate. We
calculated the electrostatic potential distribution near the
double vacancy along the horizontal and vertical cuts at 3 Å
above the graphene plane (Figure 5a) to quantify the change.
We obtained a local perturbation of the potential, created by
charge redistribution due to the formation of the defects and
the perturbed ﬁeld extends over distances of the order of
vacancy size and has an amplitude of ∼80 meV at 3 Å above
the plane. The larger potential energy for electrons near the
defect means a larger change in the local WF, which would
slow down the rate of electron removal during the oxidation
step (Figure 5). A similar change in the WF behavior can also
be expected for MLG-Cu structures, speciﬁcally near the
defects in a top graphene layer of MLG-Cu.

After assessing the inﬂuence of vacancy defects, we studied
the eﬀect of grain boundaries (GB) on the corrosion resistance
of SLG over Cu by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM)
analyses. The GB is indicated by a dashed white rectangle
(Figure 6a) as marked between the two grains. Figure 6a−f
shows the KPFM topography and WF distribution proﬁle of a
pristine region of the SLG-Cu sample as well as the region
exposed to 1 M H2SO4 corrodent, speciﬁcally around the GB
region. We chose H2SO4 as a model for aggressive corrodent as
it prevails in anoxic microbial environments. Such acid

As shown in the WF proﬁle (Figures 6f), the WF values in
the GB region are signiﬁcantly lower compared to its
surrounding grains for both the pristine and exposed samples.
The lower the WF the higher the tendency to donate the
electrons and lower the corrosion resistance. However, such a
drop in WF is higher for the exposed GB regions (∼4.68 eV)
compared to their pristine counterparts (∼4.82 eV).

The adhesion force map or the work done by the metallic tip
apex moving away from the surface is also higher at the GB
regions (depicted by the bright regions in Figure 6c). This
force map indicates the preferential surface chemistry of the
GB toward the corrodent and the region of the exposed SLG-
Cu (a solid line rectangle in Figure 6d) displays the presence of
the salt impurities. To conclude, the GB in atomic graphene
layers promote the higher charge injection tendency in SLG-
Cu and a greater accumulation of the corrodent particles,
suggesting the enhanced adhesive characteristics of GBs
compared to the grains. Thus, grain boundaries can reduce
the overall corrosion resistance of SLG on Cu.

Furthermore, we explored the protection ability of atomic
graphene layers on other metals such as nickel (Ni) substrates
(details are provided in Figures S5 and S6). We have carried
out the DFT calculations to understand the WF behavior of
SLG-Ni and MLG-Ni as a function of Ni-graphene distance
(d). Also, we conducted a KPFM study to determine the WF
of SLG-Ni and MLG-Ni substrates exposed to 1 M H2SO4
corrodent. Then, we conducted a comparative analysis by
Raman Spectroscopy to study the doping and strain behavior
of the SLG-Ni and SLG-Cu, for both pre- and postcorrosion
conditions. The DFT analysis and KPFM study depicted lower
WF of SLG-Ni compared to MLG-Ni, suggesting the greater

activity of the electrons that participate in relevant electro-
chemical processes and lower (more negative) corrosion
potential. Hence, MLG-Ni oﬀers superior corrosion protection
compared to SLG-Ni, similarly aligned with the ﬁndings from
the Cu case (Figure 4). Raman studies conﬁrmed that the
atomic graphene layers on both Cu and Ni substrates stayed
intact even after the prolonged exposure to the 1 M H2SO4
corrodent (Figure S7a,b). However, SLG-Ni displays a distinct
deconvoluted strain and doping behavior compared to SLG-Cu
at the pre- and postexposure conditions (Figure S7c) and
suggests that SLG-Cu is more prone to corrosion compared to
SLG-Ni, aligning with the results of the DFT simulations

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, metals used in biointerface applications are
susceptible to microbial attack, a problem costing billions of
dollars across the world. Although atomic graphene layers do
not
they can
eﬀectively restrict the diﬀusion of aggressive metabolites to the
underlying Cu surfaces and prevent biogenic sulﬁde attack.
Owing to the small density of states, single-layered graphene
displays distinct quantum capacitance eﬀect and increases the
electrical double layer capacitance and copper dissolution at
the copper
interfaces. This quantum capacitance eﬀect
decreases with the increase in the number of atomic graphene
layers.31 Thus, graphene coating should be designed rationally
to minimize the impact of the capacitance eﬀect, while taking
into account the interplay between the inherent defects and the
dynamics of
inevitable bioﬁlm growth and associated
phenotypical and genotypic responses, all of which impact
biogenic sulﬁde attack.

METHODS
A comprehensive description of the experimental procedures has been
provided in the Supporting Information, and only a brief account is
given below. Single-layer graphene (SLG) was grown on copper foil
(25 μm thick) using a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition
(LPCVD) at 1000 °C and 500 mTorr with a methane gas ﬂow of 35
sccm. Multilayer graphene (MLG) was synthesized on copper foil (25
μm thick) by CVD at 940 °C under a pressure of 1.01 × 105 Pa and
CH4:H2 ﬂow ratio 10:30 (sccm) as described previously.1 The CVD-
grown SLG and MLG on copper foil (Bare Cu) are designated as
SLG- Cu and MLG-Cu, respectively.

All electrochemical tests were carried out using a Gamry Reference
600 potentiostat. All of the tests were carried out using samples (bare
Cu, SLG-Cu, and MLG-Cu) with an exposure area of 1 cm2. The
measurements were obtained after achieving steady-state OCP
conditions. Microbial corrosion experiments were carried out in a
400 mL single compartment corrosion Cell Kit (Gamry Instruments)
consisting of a graphite plate as a counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl as a
reference electrode (RE), and the sample of interest as a working
electrode (WE). The D. alaskensis strain G20 (DA-G20) that was
anaerobically grown in the Lactate C (L-C) medium was used in all of
the MIC experiments.

DFT calculations were performed using local density approx-
imation (LDA) density functional, as implemented in the Quantum
Espresso package.39 Bernal (AB) stacking was used to model
multilayer structures. In multilayer graphene, the z coordinate of
the graphene layer nearest to the Cu surface was ﬁxed, and all other
coordinates were fully relaxed. Similarly, the z coordinate of the top
layer of the Cu(111) slab was ﬁxed, while other coordinates were fully
relaxed. The equilibrium interlayer distance after
the geometry
optimization was 3.36 Å.

Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM): The KPFM investigations
were performed using atomic force microscopy (AFM)-Bruker
Dimension Icon. Peak-force KPFM through two pass modes has
been used in the characterization; in the ﬁrst pass, a topography image
was collected, and the second pass for the potential map (contact
potential diﬀerence, CPD). Conductive tip from Bruker (Model:
PFQNE-Al, stiﬀness ≈ 0.8 ± 0.2 N/m, diameter ≈ 5 nm, resonance
frequency = 300 kHz) has been used for the measurements. The
calculation of the tip work function (WF) was carried out using
− eVdc.
freshly cleaved HOPG using the relation, WFsample = WFtip
The same relation is used to measure local WF of unaﬀected and
corroded graphene.

The Raman spectroscopy was carried out with a 532 nm laser line,
1800 grating line/mm using the Renishaw inVia 100X optical lens.
The laser power was limited to 5% (<1 mW) throughout the duration.
The Raman peaks were ﬁtted using the Lorentzian function to
measure the peak positions for G and 2D peak.
