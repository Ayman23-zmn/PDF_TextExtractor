Optical, SEM, TEM, Raman, and contact angle analysis of SLG- Cu and MLG-Cu  

To analyze the graphene samples by optical and Raman spectroscopy, we transferred the 

films to a SiO2/Si substrate using the PMMA procedure detailed in previous literature.1 The optical 

images  were  obtained  using  a  Carl  Zeiss Axio vision  microscope  in  bright  field  mode  using  a 

10X HD-DIC objective lens. The images were captured using a Zeiss Axio Cam MRC 5 camera 

and  later  processed  using  Axiovision  SE64  software. A  Zeiss  Supra40  scanning  electron 

microscope (SEM) equipped with X-ray microanalysis was used to get the images of the graphene 

films on copper foil. For TEM analysis, the films were transferred onto a Holey carbon support 

film on a Cu 400 mesh grid. JEM-2100 LaB6 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) (JEOL, 

USA)  was  used  to  obtain  high-resolution  TEM  (HRTEM)  images  and  selected  area  electron 

diffraction (SAED) patterns. Raman spectrometer equipped with a microscope (Foster + Freeman 

Ltd,  Evesham,  UK)  was  used  to obtain the  peaks  for  SLG  and  MLG  films  transferred  on  to  a 

SiO2/Si wafer. The measurements were carried at an incident power of 10 mW, a laser excitation 

wavelength of 532 nm, and using a 100-objective lens. The wettability of the graphene coatings 

was evaluated by a contact angle goniometer (Model 500, ramé-hart Instrument Co.). The obtained 

water droplets  were  analyzed  by  DROP-image  Advanced  v  2.4  software  to  estimate  the  water 

contact angle (WCA).  

Preparation of Sulfate-reducing bacterial (SRB) strain and its culture  

The Desulfovibrio alaskensis strain G20 (DA-G20) was anaerobically grown in the Lactate 

C (L-C) medium containing the following constituents (g/L): sodium lactate, 6.8; sodium sulfate, 

4.5; sodium citrate, 0.3; dehydrated calcium chloride, 0.06; ammonium chloride, 1.0; magnesium 

sulfate, 2.0; potassium phosphate monobasic, 0.5 and yeast extract, 1.0.2 The listed L-C medium 

components were mixed thoroughly using type III ASTM Standards for Laboratory Reagent Water 

 

2 

(ASTM D1193-91). The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.2 and then sterilized by autoclaving 

at 121 OC for 30 min. The DA-G20 cultures were grown in 150 mL serum bottles containing 100 

mL  of  L-C having  a headspace  of  N2-H2 (95%  N2  v/v  and  5%  H2 v/v). DA-G20 cultures  were 

incubated at 30 °C using modest agitation (125 rpm) on an orbital platform shaker for 48 h.  

Microbial corrosion experiments  

MIC experiments were carried out in a 400 mL single compartment corrosion Cell (Gamry 

Instruments)  consisting  of  a  graphite  plate  as  a  counter  electrode,  an  Ag/AgCl  as  a  reference 

electrode  (RE),  and  the  sample  of  interest  as  a  working  electrode  (WE). The  graphene-coated 

copper  samples were  mounted laterally on  a  stainless-steel  sample  bracket  (Gamry  part  #  990-

00254) facing the L-C growth medium. An electroplating tape was used to limit the exposure area 

to 1 cm2  of coated copper samples. Before inoculating with DA-G20, the corrosion cell having the 

L-C growth medium was purged with sterile nitrogen gas (15 psi) for 30 min to obtain an anaerobic 

condition. The MIC experiments were performed at 30 °C and with an initial inoculum of 10% 

(v/v), a pH of 7.2, and a cell count = 105 cells/mL.   

 Electrochemical measurements  

Linear  polarization  resistance  (LPR)  tests  were  run  in  triplicate  using  the  following 

parameters: potential = ±10 mV (vs. open-circuit potential (OCP)), scan rate = 0.125 mV/s, initial 

delay  = 1200 s,  and stability = 0.1 mV/s. Corrosion rates from  the LPR tests  were determined 

using the Tafel constant values for the anodic and cathodic slopes from the Tafel experiment. The 

cyclic  voltammetry  (CV)  tests  were  carried  out  consecutively  for  four  different  cycles  under  a 

potential  range  of  -700  mV  to  +500  mV  (vs.  Ag/AgCl)  and  a  scan  rate  of  0.1  mV/s.  The 

Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) tests were carried out in the potential range of - 300 mV to 

1000 mV (vs. OCP) with a scan rate of 0.2 mV/s. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) 

 

3 

tests  were  performed  at  the  OCP  using  an  AC  signal  with  an  amplitude  of  ±10  mV,  and  the 

corresponding EIS spectra were obtained in the 10000 to 0.01 Hz range. Gamry Echem Analyst 

was used to fit the EIS results to an electrical equivalent circuit (EEC).  

Corrosion rates (mils per year (mpy)) were determined by substituting Rp and Icorr values 

obtained from equation (1) in equation (2).

analysis that was carried out with a scan rate of 1 mV/s.in the potential range of ± 250 mV (vs.

respectively. The protection efficiency was calculated by substituting the values of current density 

obtained from Tafel analysis in the equation.  

 

Characterization of biofilm and corrosion deposits  

A Zeiss Supra40 variable pressure field emission SEM fitted with an advanced system for 

X-ray  microanalysis  (Oxford  Aztec  Energy)  was  used  to obtain  the  surface  morphology  and 

elemental composition of the biofilm and the corrosion products. The SEM was operated using an 

accelerated voltage of 5 kV for imaging and 15 kV to determine the elemental composition of the 

corrosion products.

EEC circuit  

The EEC circuit includes a solution resistance (Rs) in series with single time constants one 

representing the metal/ electrolyte interface for Faradaic charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the 

capacitance due to the double layer (Qdl) (Figure S3a). The value of the constant phase element 

capacitance (Q) was converted into capacitance (C) by using its corresponding resistance (R) value 

using equation (3).3

where n is the exponent in the constant phase element  

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations 

Work  functions  were  calculated  from  density  functional  theory  using  local  density 

approximation (LDA) functional, as implemented in the Quantum Espresso.4  Scalar relativistic 

ultrasoft pseudopotentials were used to represent ionic cores, as implemented in the pslibrary,5 and 

50 Ry kinetic energy cutoff was used. A k-grid of 21×21×1 was used for Brillouin zone sampling, 

with Gaussian smearing. Cu(111) and Ni(111) surfaces were represented by 6-layer slabs, Bernal 

(AB) stacking was used for multi-layer graphene, and a vacuum space of 15 Å between the periodic 

images was added in the normal direction in all calculations. Dipole correction was used in the 

normal direction. The graphene-metal distance (d) was defined as the distance between the nearest 

graphene layer and a top layer of metal atoms, and the Z coordinate of the nearest graphene plane 

and the top metal layer was held fixed during geometry optimization. All other coordinates were 

relaxed using the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm until all unconstrained 

force components were less than 2.6 meV/Å. In calculating the work function, dipole correction 

 

5 

was  applied  in  the  direction  normal  to  the  surface,  and  the  work  function  was  defined  as  the 

difference between the vacuum potential outside of the graphene and Fermi level (Figure S4). 

The Raman measurements were carried out with a 532 nm laser line, 1800 grating line/mm 

using  the  Renishaw  inVia™  100X  optical  lens.   The  laser  power  was  limited  to  5%  (<  1mW) 

throughout the duration. The Raman peaks were fitted using the Lorentzian function to measure 

the  peak  positions  for  G  and  2D  peak.  For  evaluating  the  strain  and  doping  characteristics  of 

graphene using a correlation plot, the strain (ε) and the charge carrier concentration (n) of graphene 

were related to Raman shift (G, 2D) as presented in equation (4).6

influence n and ε. 

The  Kelvin  probe  force  microscopy  (KPFM)  investigation  was  performed  using  atomic 

force microscopy (AFM)-Bruker Dimension Icon. Peak-force KPFM through two pass modes has 

been  used  in  the  characterization;  in  the  first  pass,  a  topography  image  was  collected,  and  the 

second pass for the potential map (contact potential difference, CPD). Conductive tip from Bruker 

 

6 

(Model: PFQNE-Al, stiffness  0.8±0.2 N/m, diameter  5 nm, resonance frequency = 300 KHz) 

has been used for the measurements. The calculation of the tip work function (WF) was carried 

out using freshly cleaved HOPG using the relation, WFsample = WFtip – eVdc. The same relation 

was used to measure the local WF of the pristine and exposed samples.      

Results and discussion 

Protection  ability  of  atomic  graphene  layers  on  Nickel  (Ni)  substrates:  We  further 

explored the protective ability of atomic graphene layers on nickel (Ni) substrates. First, we carried 

out density functional theory (DFT) simulations to study the WF behavior of Ni (111) modified 

with SLG and MLG, for graphene-Ni interlayer distance (d) ranging up to 6 Å. Next, KPFM was 

conducted to experimentally study the WF behavior of SLG-Ni and MLG-Ni substrates exposed 

to a corrosive environment (2 h, 1M H2SO4). Finally, we carried out Raman analyses to study the 

doping and strain behavior of the SLG-Ni in comparison to those of SLG-Cu, both exposed to the 

H2SO4 corrodent. 

Upon adsorption of graphene layers, Ni (111) showed a significant drop in the WF values 

as a function of graphene-Ni interlayer distance (d) (Figure S5). At d < 3 Å, the WF of SLG-Ni 

(~3.5 eV) and MLG-Ni (~4.7 eV) was significantly lower than bare Ni (~5.4 eV). The SLG-Ni 

and  MLG-Ni  displayed  lower  WF  even  for  3  Å<d  <6  Å  (Figure  S5).  Interestingly,  SLG-Ni 

experienced the highest drop in the WF (ΔWF = -1.9 eV) compared to MLG-Ni (ΔWF = -0.7 eV) 

at d < 3 Å. Even, the WF of SLG-Ni (~3.5 eV) is found to be lower than free-standing graphene 

(~4.6 eV). The lower the WF the greater is the activity of the electrons that participate in relevant 

electrochemical  processes,  lower  (more  negative)  is  the  corrosion  potential  and  weaker  is  the 

protective ability of atomic graphene layers. Thus, MLG-Ni is expected to offer superior corrosion 

 

7 

protection compared to SLG-Ni, similarly aligned with the findings from the Cu test case (Figure 

4). 

Next, we conducted KPFM tests to assess experimentally the WF behavior of SLG-Ni and 

MLG-Ni exposed to 1M H2SO4, a corrodent typical to MIC conditions (Figure S6). An epitaxially 

grown SLG film on polycrystalline Ni substrates was used for the KPFM study. The report from 

the KPFM study corroborate the findings from DFT analysis: (1) WF of the both MLG-Ni (~4.95 

eV) and  SLG-Ni (~4.75 eV) are lower than Ni (~4.98 eV); (2) Upon exposure to the corrodent, 

WF of both SLG-Ni and MLG-Ni experienced a significant drop in WF. The ΔWF for SLG-Ni 

(~200 meV) and MLG-Ni (~50 meV) was two-fold and four-fold lower than bare Ni, respectively. 

However,  ΔWF  for  MLG-Ni  was  four-fold  lower  than  SLG-Ni,  corroborating  that  MLG  offers 

better corrosion protection to Ni.          

Convoluted  strain  and  doping  effect  behavior  of  graphene  layers  exposed  to  1M 

H2SO4:  Our  Raman  studies  confirmed  that  the  atomic  graphene  layers  on  both  Cu  and  Ni 

substrates stayed intact even after the prolonged exposure to the 1M H2SO4 corrodent (Figure S7a, 

S7b). However, upon the exposure, both SLG-Cu and SLG-Ni displayed a convoluted strain and 

doping  effect,  shown  by  the  systematic  shift  in  G  and  2D  peaks,  respectively  (Figure  S7). We 

report  that  SLG-Ni  displays  a  distinct  doping  behavior  compared  to  SLG-Cu,  as  shown  in  the 

correlation  plot  (Figure  S7c).  While  SLG-Ni  experienced  a  compressive  strain  with  minimal 

change  in  the  carrier  concentration  (n),  SLG-Cu  experienced  a  notable  increase  in  the  carrier 

concentration (n) with an incremental change to the tensile strain. These results suggest that SLG-

Cu  is  more  prone  to  corrosion  compared  to  SLG-Ni,  aligning  with  the  results  of  the  DFT 

simulations. For example, Ni (111) experienced a decrease in WF only when modified with SLG 

 

8 

(Figure S5); whereas, Cu (111) experienced a decrease in WF when modified with SLG as well 

as with MLG (2 and 3 layers, respectively) (Figure 4).  

The  pristine  SLG-Ni  and  SLG-Cu  samples  also  displayed  a  varying  degree  of  the 

deconvoluted strain and doping effect. The differences can be attributed to the differences in the 

nature of the coupling between atomic graphene layers with their respective substrates. The pristine 

forms of SLG-Ni and SLG-Cu lie at a different location of the doping axis (brown line), suggesting 

a varying extent of doping of the two substrates. The distribution of Raman data for pristine SLG-

Cu illustrates the lower carrier concentration as compared to SLG-Ni. This variation is attributed 

to  the  differences  in  the  metallic  characteristics  of  the  two  substrates,  resulting  in  a  different 

electron-phonon coupling. The SLG-Ni exposed to the corrodent displayed a higher compressive 

strain with minimal change in doping concentration compared to the pristine SLG-Ni (shaded by 

yellow color). However, upon the exposure, the SLG-Cu experienced a significant increase in the 

tensile strain as well as carrier concentration (fewer negative values of n as shaded by green color) 

compared to the pristine region. A considerable distribution of peaks of graphene over Cu is due 

to a change in the physical texture of the Cu surface after exposure to the corrodent, which was 

mitigated over Ni. This finding indicates that SLG-Cu is more vulnerable to 1M H2SO4 corrodent 

compared to SLG Ni, agreeing with the findings of the KPFM studies.  

Effects of surface roughness on corrosion behavior. We discuss the effect of the different 

copper surfaces as shown in Figure 2 on the corrosion behavior. The water contact angle values 

(Figure 1h-j) or the wetting characteristics of bare Cu surface are related to its higher roughness 

due to highly oxidized surfaces especially at the striation's steps produced during foil’s processing 

(Figure 2b). These oxidized steps at striation are active sites (i.e. with more ledges and kinks) to 

interact with corrodents. Such surface corrugation fluctuates the electron work function which is 

 

9 

predicted to promote corrosion.8 It has been reported that electrons in the vicinity of the peak of a 

protrusion are easier to escape than those in trough sites, thus peak region would be a preferential 

corrosion site.9 The annealing of the Cu surface in the CVD chamber minimizes the striation and 

flatten  the  surface.  Subsequently,  the  epitaxially  grown  graphene  over  Cu  surface  induces 

hydrophobic characteristics with an elevation of nearly 10 degrees in contact angle.
