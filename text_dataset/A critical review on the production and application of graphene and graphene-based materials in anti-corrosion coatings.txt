ABSTRACT
Among the many potential applications of graphene and graphene-based materials, their
use as protective films or as additives in coatings for corrosion protection has seen an
increased level of interest in the last decade. Much of this interest is motivated by the need
to implement additional functionalities, to enhance anti-corrosion performance and to ultim-
ately extend the service life of metallic structures. Pristine graphene films, with their imper-
meable nature allied to flexibility and mechanical strength, appear as particularly attractive
candidates for barrier films against corrosive agents, while graphene-based materials such
as graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide offer a wide range of opportunities for their
dispersion in polymeric matrices for composite anti-corrosive coatings. Simultaneously, con-
siderable progress in the development of scalable graphene and graphene-based materials
production techniques has been made during the last several years. Currently, a broad
range of graphene materials with different morphologies and properties is available, making
the need for an adequate fit between the production method and the desired application
even more evident. This review article aims to give the reader a general overview of the
recent trends in both the production of graphene and graphene-based materials, and their
implementation in different anti-corrosion solutions. Moreover, the present work provides a
critical look on this subject, highlighting the areas in need of further exploration.

1. Introduction

With the discovery of graphene in 2004 by Geim and
Novoselov[1] a whole new field in materials science,
chemistry and physics has opened. Seventeen years
later we are approaching a time when the industry
can provide this material
in quality and quantity
required for its application. Graphene is known for its
outstanding electron mobility,[2,3] highest
thermal
conductivity of all materials, on par with diamond
and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and 12 times that of
copper,[4–6] a mechanical breaking strength of 42 N/m
(311 times higher than that of steel), and a Young’s
modulus of 1.0 ± 0.1 TPa.[7]

The application of graphene as a functional layer or as
an additive in coatings for corrosion protection has been
attracting considerable interest in the last decade. The
main driving force behind this interest relies on the need
to implement additional functionalities, to enhance coat-
ing performance and thus extend the service life of metallic
structures under extreme conditions.[8,9] Graphene’s
impermeability to gases[10] provided the first indication of
it being capable of acting as a physical barrier to corrosive
species. Moreover, its chemical inertness with respect to
oxidative etching up to temperatures of 400 C,[11] along
with the promise of an extremely lightweight coating that
does not significantly affect the underlying material’s
optical properties, have further motivated the research
efforts into graphene’s application in corrosion protection.
Several recent reviews have described the breadth
of research works in this area, thereby supporting the
fact that graphene and graphene-based materials can
and will play a central role in the protection of metal-
lic substrates.[12–14] However, it must be said that the
remarkable figures ascribed to graphene are com-
monly (and incorrectly) presented in the works related
to any graphene-based material, when in reality they
are only applicable to the pristine single-layer gra-
phene (SLG). As a result, the main aim of the present
review is to render a critical look on the implementa-
tion of graphene and graphene-based materials in the

field of protective coatings, combining a description
of the different production methods of such materials
with an overview of the recent trends in their imple-
mentation in corrosion protection, something which,
to the best of our knowledge, has not yet been done.

As it will be made clear throughout this review, the
range of properties of the graphene derivatives obtained
by different processes is so wide that their grouping
under the single word graphene would be scientifically
inaccurate. Therefore, we will opt to follow the nomen-
clature for the classification of these materials according
to the ISO/TS 80004-13:2017, namely:

1. Graphene, graphene layer, single-layer graphene
(SLG), monolayer graphene: single layer of carbon
atoms with each atom bound to three neighbors
in a honeycomb structure.

3. Few-layer

(FLG):

2. Bilayer graphene (2LG):

two-dimensional material
consisting of two well-defined stacked graphene layers.
two-dimensional
material consisting of three to ten well-defined
stacked graphene layers.

graphene

4. Graphene oxide (GO): chemically modified gra-
phene prepared by oxidation and exfoliation of
graphite, causing extensive oxidative modification
of the basal plane. Graphene oxide is a single-
layer material with high oxygen content, typically
characterized by C/O atomic ratios of approxi-
mately 2.0, depending on the method of synthesis.
5. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO): reduced oxygen

content form of graphene oxide.

Additionally, based on these definitions, single-layer,
bilayer or few-layer graphene films or flakes will be gen-
erally grouped under the term “graphene,” while any
other two-dimensional carbon materials, such as GO or
rGO, will be referred to as “graphene-based materials.”

This review, outlined in Figure 1, is divided into
four main sections. Firstly (section 2), different pro-
duction methods are presented, giving particular

attention to methods to obtain high-quality graphene,
high-throughput processes to produce graphene and
methods to obtain graphene oxide and reduced
graphene oxide. The following two sections are
devoted to anti-corrosion applications, with works
associated with graphene and graphene-based films
(section 3) and composites using graphene (section
4) being discussed separately. The review ends
with a critical overview of the field (section 5),

lenges associated with implementation of graphene

graphene production methods

The first successful method to isolate graphene was
through mechanical exfoliation of graphite by succes-
sive peelings using scotch tape.[1] This method produ-
ces high-quality,

graphene flakes. However, its throughput is very low,
and its upscaling is unreasonable.

One of the earliest alternative synthesis methods
that emerged was that of epitaxial graphene obtained
by graphitization of silicon carbide (SiC).[15] By heat-
ing up single-crystal SiC in ultrahigh vacuum condi-
tions (or even at atmospheric pressure),[16]
the Si
atoms are sublimated, with the remaining C atoms

undergoing graphitization. This process can occur on
both the Si-terminated face and on the C-terminated
one. In the former case, a C-rich buffer layer cova-
lently bonded to the substrate is present underneath
the formed graphene, while in the latter case the
interaction with the substrate is much weaker.[17]
With the emergence of this synthesis approach, it was
quickly established that the obtained graphene is of
high quality, with charge carrier mobilities up to
27,000 cm2 V 1 s 1 reported as early as 2006, for gra-
face.[18]

However, the main disadvantage of graphene synthesis
from SiC remains the high price of the substrates,[19]

Alternatively, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has
been one of the most prominent graphene synthesis
techniques since the early reports showing surface seg-
regation of carbon atoms into graphene domains and
continuous layers from transition metals.[21–23] Yu
et al., for example, were able to form high-quality gra-
phene layers by exposing a Ni foil to a mixture of
CH4, H2, and Ar at 1000 C (at atmospheric pressure).
The process was explained on the basis of hydrocar-
bon gas decomposition, followed by carbon atom dif-
fusion into the metal foil. A controlled cooling of the
substrate then leads to carbon segregation, forming
graphene layers at the surface. Moreover, the authors
showed that this graphene can be transferred onto
insulating substrates using a support layer (silicone

point. However,

Shortly after, copper came forth as the preferred
growth substrate, thanks to its low carbon solubility
and catalytic effect on the hydrocarbon precursor
breakdown, allowing to grow continuous SLG films
(Figure 2(a)).[24] Typical CVD graphene synthesis on
copper is conducted at temperatures close to the lat-
ter’s melting
low-temperature
(300–400 C) growth has also been demonstrated,
using microwave plasma to assist in the decompos-
ition of the hydrocarbon precursors.[25] Currently, the
CVD method allows to obtain graphene domains
exceeding millimetric sizes[26] (Figure 2(b)) and arbi-
trarily large single-crystal films,[27] as well as graphene
with charge carrier mobilities as high as 350,000 cm2
V 1 s 1,[3] with growth at both low and atmospheric
pressures possible.[28]

Here, it should be pointed out that, in many cases,
graphene grown epitaxially or using a catalyst must be
transferred onto a different substrate where it can be
processed or incorporated directly for the desired

application. An example of this is the transfer of gra-
phene onto insulating substrates for lithographic fabri-
cation of electronic devices, or onto transparent
substrates for optical applications.
In the case of
CVD-grown graphene on copper,
the copper can
either be etched away,[29,30] or the graphene can be
separated from the copper. The latter can be done
electrochemically, by forming hydrogen gas bubbles,
through hydrolysis, between graphene and copper,
exfoliating the former from the latter (Figure 2(c)).[31]
Alternatively, water molecules can be intercalated
between the graphene and the substrate, weakening
their interaction and allowing to pick up the sample
using a stamp.[32] Either way, in most cases, a sup-
porting material must be used in order to avoid the
tearing or any other damage to the graphene film
after its separation from the copper. The most com-
monly used supporting material is poly(methyl meth-
acrylate) (PMMA), which is usually spin-coated on
the as-grown graphene at the beginning of the transfer
process. However, the removal of the PMMA support
layer after the transfer is complete, which is typically
done by placing the transferred sample in acetone,

leaves behind PMMA residues which are known to be
difficult to eliminate completely.[33,34] These residues
influence graphene’s properties, mainly by giving rise
to a p-type doping. Some solutions to this problem
have been reported in the literature, namely by means
of high-temperature annealings[34] or plasma treat-
ments.[35] Other approaches seek to avoid PMMA

Independently of

the production method, high
crystalline quality single-layer graphene can be charac-
terized by narrow 2D and G characteristic Raman
peaks, with a high ratio of the respective intensities,
as well as by the absence (or very low intensity) of the
characteristic D peak associated with structural defects
(Figure 2(d)).[40]

2.2. High-throughput graphene

production methods

For many commercial applications, a high production
throughput and economic viability are still the main
requirements
the preferred synthesis
approach. After the original mechanical exfoliation of
graphite using
of

other methods

scotch tape,

in terms of

exfoliation were developed trying to follow a similar
approach. The main ones are briefly reviewed below.

2.2.1. Ball milling exfoliation
Exfoliation of graphite by ball milling can be accom-
plished making use of either planetary ball mills[41–48]
(in dry or wet conditions) or stirred ball mills.[49,50]
In a ball milling process, the precursor material
is
loaded, together with the milling balls, inside the mill-
ing chamber, followed by a continuous rolling of the
balls along the chamber’s walls. This rolling action
transfers energy to the precursor both through shear
stresses due to the friction effect of the balls rolling
along the chamber’s walls and through direct impact
of the balls on the material to be milled (Figure 3(a)).
Different types of equipment can exploit this general
principle, such as planetary mills, vibratory mills, and
attritor mills, among others.[52] The motion of the
grinding balls is typically caused by inertial forces due
to the movement of the milling chamber, or, in the
case of the attritor mill, due to the rotation of the
impeller arms inside the chamber. The main parame-
ters that can be controlled are thus milling speed,
time, grinding medium, ball-to-precursor ratio, tem-
perature, and milling atmosphere.[52]

For the ball milling production of graphene, the
most commonly used precursor is graphite, although

6

helical ribbon carbon nanofibers, for instance, have
also been exfoliated by this technique.[41] With graph-
ite, the milling itself may not be sufficient for success-
ful graphene exfoliation, as it has been shown to
in an amorphization of graphite’s crystalline
result
structure, due to the damage caused by the milling
balls, which distorts the aromatic rings of the graph-
ite.[53,54] This damage has been observed by both X-
ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy after 15 to
20 h of milling.[53]

In one of the earliest examples of graphene produc-
tion by ball milling, Zhao et al.[55] milled 30 to 80 nm
thick graphite nanoplatelets for 30 h in dimethylfor-
mamide (DMF), using a planetary mill. The shear
forces induced by the milling process, along with the
DMF-graphene interaction, allowed to exfoliate the
graphite nanoplatelets into graphene sheets with up to
three layers, as reported by the authors, while the low
rotation speed of the rotating tray allowed to have less
in-plane stress capable of damaging the graphite
flakes. Other organic solvents have also been success-
fully employed for graphite exfoliation into graphene
by ball milling, with the importance of a match
between the surface tension of the solvent and that of
graphene having been highlighted.[56] Sodium dodecyl
sulfate has also been used as a surfactant for ball
milled graphene flakes, as demonstrated by Knieke
et al.[50] using a stirred media mill. As an alternative,
naphthol polyoxyethylene ether (NPE), a more envir-
onmentally-friendly and more easily removable surfac-
tant, has also been used, resulting in graphene flakes
with fewer than 10 layers.[57]

A systematic study of the influence of the process
conditions and parameters in wet ball milling of
graphite has been performed by Damm et al.[49] The
authors, besides stating that stirred media mills allow
to exfoliate graphite in a relatively shorter time (few
hours instead of few tens of hours) and with better
temperature control than planetary mills, point out
that the Hansen solubility parameters of the used sol-
vents are some of the main factors determining their
suitability for graphite exfoliation into graphene, as
previously shown by Coleman’s group.[51] More spe-
cifically, the parameter for the disperse interaction,
dD, should have a value of around 18 MPa1[N/A]2
(Figure 3(b)), as is the case for N-methylpyrrolidone
(NMP) and cyclohexanone (CHO). The viscosity of
the solvent also plays an important role, with the
more viscous ones facilitating the energy transfer from
the grinding balls to the graphite while attenuating
the direct impact of the balls, in order to prevent in-
plane damage. In summary, wet ball milling can be

attractive for graphene production. However, it should
be pointed out that, unfortunately, wet ball milling
often requires additional purification steps to remove
the solvents.[58]

As a way to avoid the need to remove surfactants
and solvents from the obtained graphene dispersions,
as well as to avoid the functionalization of the gra-
phene sheets, which can be detrimental to its proper-
ties, Liu et al.[48] proposed a dry ball milling graphene
production method. In a process taking up to 4 h,
graphite was milled in the presence of ammonia bor-
ane (NH3BH3). The authors claimed that ammonia
borane weakens the Van de Waals forces between the
graphene layers in graphite, by interacting strongly
with the latter. This results in graphene flakes of 5
layers or fewer. However, a significant degree of oxi-
dation was present, as shown via X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), and the presented Raman and
TEM analysis is insufficient to support such claims.
Triazine exfoliating agents have also shown great
promise in the context of graphite exfoliation by ball
milling.[59] Here, melamine was identified as having
the best performance, due to its aromatic nucleus cap-
able of interfacing with graphene sheets by p-p inter-
actions, as well as due to its ability to form extended
two-dimensional
through hydrogen
bonding, which lead to multipoint interactions with
graphene sheets, promoting exfoliation and stabiliza-
tion. Dry ball milling of graphite in the presence of
certain gases and dry ice[42] has been shown to permit
the production of edge-functionalized graphene flakes
that can be dispersed in several solvents,
including
pure water. In other work, a planetary mill was used
for 24 h to produce edge-carboxylated graphene from
graphite precursor using dry ice.[47] The production
of FLG was accomplished, but the structural quality of
the products is questionable, and a significant degree
of oxidation was observed. After thermal reduction,
the Raman spectra show severe defect concentration,
broadened vibrational modes and a near absence of
2D band, so that the product can hardly be denomi-
nated as graphene. In summary, the main advantage
of the dry-milling technique resides in its simplicity
and in the possibility of obtaining graphene without
contaminations. However, prolonged process times
(sometimes as long as 30 h), limit its throughput.

(2D) networks

Despite the demonstrated capability of producing
graphene flakes, ball milling presents some obvious
disadvantages. It is a scalable process only limited by
the size of the milling vessel, but it is apparent that
the high degree of structural defects, including oxida-
tion, as well as the inherent
in

functionalization,

many cases, restricts the spectrum of application of
these graphene products. The bare impact of the balls
fragments the graphene flakes into smaller flakes and
induces severe structural defects to the graphene lat-
tice, especially in basal planes.[41,42,60] This can be
minimized by slowing the rotation speed at
the
expense of
the process time, which can extend to
more than one day.[45,56] Ball milling is, thus, time
consuming and many thick flakes are present in the
final products, despite some single- and few-layer gra-
phene. It generally requires post sonication[43,60] or
assistance by exfoliating compounds[41,45,48,59,60]
in
order to decrease flake thickness and increase the
exfoliation yield, as well as additional purification
steps to remove the solvents, in the case of wet ball
milling. Table 1 summarizes the experimental condi-
tions employed in a number of works on graphene
production by ball milling.

2.2.2. Sonication
In sonication, ultrasonic waves produce localized com-
pressions and rarefactions
in the liquid medium,
forming vacuum cavities which then collapse, generat-
ing high pressure jets. These jets are capable of peel-
ing off graphene layers from graphite, as well as
weakening the Van der Waals interaction between the
layers. This facilitates the intercalation of solvent mol-
ecules between graphitic planes, allowing for further
exfoliation and consequent stabilization of the disper-
sion. As with other graphite exfoliation approaches,
attention must be paid to the choice of the dispers-
ing solvent.

Hernandez et al.,[63] for example, noted NMP’s role
in successful dispersion of carbon nanotubes. The
authors then went on to use it in a similar way for
the dispersion of graphite powder by bath sonication,
resulting in flakes of 5 or fewer graphene layers, with
lateral dimensions of
the order of micrometers.
Similar results were also obtained with g-butyrolac-
tone
1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone
(DMEU) solvents, also known for their ability to dis-
perse carbon nanotubes. A more detailed study of
sonication dispersion in NMP showed that, for up to
343 h of bath sonication, the average number of layers
in the flakes does not change, remaining at around 3,
while the lateral size follows a t 1/2 dependence.[64]
The authors also point out the high boiling point of
NMP as a disadvantage (this issue also applies to
some other solvents used in graphene production by
sonication, such as benzylamine).[65] Moreover, being
a polar solvent, NMP imposes some constraints on
the obtained dispersions’ chemistry, such as being

(and,

thus,

requiring

the

exclusion

(C6F5CF3),

In an attempt to overcome the issues concerning
the use of NMP as a dispersion solvent, its substitu-
tion by ethanol, by successive sonication, centrifuga-
tion, and filtering steps, has been shown to lead to
stable dispersions of graphene flakes.[66] Dispersion in
a nonpolar solvent was also attempted by using ortho-
dichlorobenzene (ODCB).[67,68] ODCB, being aro-
matic, is a known reaction solvent for fullerenes and a
carbon nanotube dispersant, believed to be efficient
thanks to p-p interactions (though it has to be noted
that other aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene,
xylenes, chlorobenzene, and pyridine were unsuccess-
ful in dispersing graphite in this study).[67] Besides, it
has a surface tension of 36.6 mJ m 2, which is close to
the range of surface tensions that have been suggested
to be good for graphite exfoliation.[63] Also in the
context of aromatic molecules, but in this case per-
fluorinated ones, hexafluorobenzene (C6F6), octafluor-
otoluene
pentafluorobenzonitrile
(C6F5CN), and pentafluoropyridine (C5F5N), were
shown to be successful as solvents for ultrasonication
of graphite into graphene.[69] The results are explained
on the basis of electron-withdrawing properties of the
fluorine atoms, resulting in charge transfer through
p-p stacking, which promotes solubilization. Pyrene
and anthracene-based compounds have also found use
as dispersion agents during sonication exfoliation, as
exemplified by 1-pyrenemethylamine (Py-NH2) and
1,3,6,8-pyrenetetrasulfonic acid (Py-SO3),[70] as well as
by 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid (PCA)[71] and 9-anthra-
cene carboxylic acid (9-ACA).[72] Low boiling-point
solvents, such as chloroform, acetone and isopropanol,
have been explored by O’Neill and coworkers.[73]
Isopropanol, in particular, showed good results, both
in terms of the number of layers obtained (less than
5), and in terms of stability (with 96% of graphene
remaining stably dispersed for as long as 200 h after
the initial dispersion). The authors claim that
the
Hansen solubility parameters of the solvents, particu-
larly the dispersive parameter, dD, dictate the quality
of the success of the dispersion, having to match those
of graphene (dD ¼ 18 MPa1/2, dP ¼ 9.3 MPa1/2, and
dH ¼ 7.7 MPa1/2) for better results.

Despite not being suitable for graphene dispersion
on its own, water has been employed for sonication
exfoliation in conjunction with surfactants such as
sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS).[74] In this
example, as much as 40% of the obtained dispersion
have been reported as having less than 5 layers of gra-
phene, with 3% of obtained flakes being single-layer

cholate (SDC) has also been used.[75]

surfactants

Guardia and coworkers compared a wide range of
different aqueous
for bath sonication
exfoliation of graphite.[76] Among these, the commer-
cial nonionic surfactant Pluronic P-123 was identified
as being particularly effective for the preparation of
graphene dispersions, allowing to achieve concentra-
tions as high as 1.5 mg/mL after 5 h of sonication.
Tween 80 gave similarly good results. Dispersions
obtained using P-123 were identified, by AFM pro-
files, to mostly have no more than 5 graphene layers,
with 10% to 15% of flakes being single-layer graphene.
Nuvoli et al.[77] dispersed graphite, by bath sonic-
ation, in an ionic liquid (1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium
hexafluorophosphate, HMIH). This approach yielded
graphene flake concentrations of 5.33 mg/mL, after
24 h of sonication and using an optimized concentra-
tion of the starting material (5.0 wt% of graphite flakes
in HMIH).

As an alternative to bath sonication, horn ultrasonica-
tion has also been employed to exfoliate naturally occur-
ring graphite flakes in the presence of a sodium cholate
amphiphilic surfactant.[78] Supplemented by density gra-
dient ultracentrifugation,
this approach yielded flakes
with an average thickness as low as 1.1 nm, with lateral
sizes ranging from 50 to several hundred nanometers.
The use of biomolecules, such as silk fibroin nanofibers,
for sonication exfoliation has also been shown.[79] Also
in an attempt to overcome the use of NMP, Sun and
coworkers dispersed graphite, by 1 hr of tip-sonication,
in amine-based solvents.[80] Namely, 3,30-iminobis(N,N-
dimethylpropylamine) (DMPA), N-[3-(dimethylamino)-
(DMAPMA), 2-(tert-butylami-
propyl]methacrylamide
no)ethyl
2-
(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate
(MAEMA) were
employed. DMPA, in particular, allowed to obtain dis-
persions with concentrations of up to 15 mg/mL, super-
ior to those obtained for NMP in control experiments.
Among aromatic molecules, tetrasodium 1,3,6,8-pyrene-
tetrasulfonic acid (TPA) was shown to be capable of
exfoliating graphite by probe sonication (in a pulsed
mode in an ice bath, with a power of 70 W, for 2 h).[81]
Here, 90 % of the obtained flakes were identified as
single-layer graphene.

and

When dealing with surfactants,

their depletion
from the solution during sonication should be taken
into account, as pointed out in a report where step-
wise or even continuous addition of fresh surfactant
was shown to result
in considerably higher yields
compared to the conventional process.[82] This was
explained by the variation in the surface tension of

the solution throughout the process due to the deple-
tion of the available surfactant as it adsorbs on the
surface of the graphene sheets. This shifts the surface
tension from the optimum value for graphite exfoli-
ation (around 41 mJ/m2, according to the report). A
continuous addition of Pluronic F108 surfactant, for
example, to a graphite dispersion in water during tip-
sonication resulted in yields of up to 1.5 wt%.
Increases in obtained yields were also observed with
the continuous addition method for a range of ionic
surfactants, including SDS.

Polymers based on aromatic molecules have also
found use as stabilizing agents in graphite sonication,
as shown by Zheng et al.[83] Here, graphite powder
and pyrene-polyethylene glycol (pyrene-PEG) or pyr-
ene-polycaprolactone (pyrene-PCL) were bath soni-
cated for 3 h in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The
obtained dispersion was then transferred to supercrit-
ical CO2, where it remained for 6 h, followed by a fur-
ther period of sonication for 2 h. After centrifugation,
the supernatant was extracted and re-dispersed either
in water (in the case of pyrene-PEG as the stabilizing
agent) or in DMSO (for pyrene-PCL). Concentrations
of up to 0.518 mg/mL were obtained (for the disper-
sion obtained using pyrene-PCL with 19 repeat units

In summary, sonication is an attractive technique
for liquid-phase exfoliation, but, much like the other
liquid-phase exfoliation approaches,
it relies on the
choice of an appropriate dispersant or stabilizing
agent. The obtained yields are relatively low, and the
long processing times, with continuous energy input,
are a drawback of sonication exfoliation. Table 2
presents the conditions employed in a number of
works on graphene production by sonication.

2.2.3. Shear stress exfoliation
Shear stress exfoliation of graphite can be accom-
plished in liquids using different types of apparatus,
relying purely on fluid dynamics considerations in
laminar or turbulent flow regimes. In particular, some
authors[91,92] employed a rotating tube at sufficiently
high rotating speeds to produce vortex fluidic films
(e.g., 7000 rpm),[91] which are capable of producing
enough shear forces to overcome Van der Waals
interactions. The graphite precursors are mixed with
organic or aqueous media and exfoliation takes place
at the tube wall via combined lifting and slippage of
graphene sheets.[58,91] The inclination of the tube was
found to play a vital role in exfoliation,
inducing

10

turbulence via combined centrifugal and gravitational
interactions, which are crucial for the lifting/slippage
process. Centrifugal forces hold the graphite precur-
sors against the tube wall and allow for the slippage
of graphene sheets. Despite the principle being suc-
cessfully demonstrated for the production of good
quality graphene, the shear stresses capable of gra-
phene exfoliation are localized only at the tube sur-
face, severely limiting the yield rate. This means that
very high surface area fast rotating tubes are needed
to improve the yield to satisfactory levels, which poses
many technological challenges at increased costs. It
was thus apparent that higher energy shear stress sys-
tems were needed to obtain graphene in a faster way
and to increase the production yield.

In this sense, it was found that pressurized fluids
containing graphite precursors inserted in constriction
channels also lead to the successful exfoliation of gra-
phene and other 2D materials via fluid dynamics
mechanisms (Figure 4(a)).[93–96] This type of exfoli-
ation was the subject of theoretical simulations show-
ing several mechanisms contributing to exfoliation
besides shear stresses, namely collision, cavitation, and
pressure release, the latter two mechanisms exerting
normal forces aiding exfoliation. Among those pro-
turbulence-induced
ducing
(Reynolds)
stresses, and
inter-flake collisions. Remarkable yields of 15% of
mainly FLG with little oxidation have been demon-
strated using high pressure pumps and closed circula-
tion loops.[96]
although constriction
tubes are usually constructed in a straight geometry,
recent theoretical simulations[95] have shown that hel-
ical tubes allow higher shear stresses, and thus more
efficient exfoliation, despite turbulence being present
in both cases.

Whilst most of the previous strategies use com-
pressed fluids to obtain the desired shear rates, an
alternative
approach using compressed air-driven
graphite suspensions through a tube was proposed in
order to decrease the defects in the produced gra-
phene because of the milder conditions compared to
pressurized fluid approaches. An extreme shear rate of
up to 3.3 107 s 1 was inferred at working pressures
as low as 0.5 MPa.[97] Nevertheless,
the calculated
yield is still low, about 1.5%. The low yield is likely
due to the fact
the extreme shear rates were
found to be concentrated at the edges of the tube at
the outlet. Indeed, by smoothing those edges the shear
rates decreased by 3 orders of magnitude, barely
above 104 s 1. Authors claimed the production of

analysis

The most common and efficient approaches using
fluid dynamics rely on rotor-stator[60,98–100] or rotat-
ing blades[101,102] immersed in a fluid containing the
graphite precursor and suitable surfactants, commonly
denominated by high-shear exfoliation (Figure 4(b)).
The authors introducing the rotor-stator technique
successfully produced highly concentrated graphene
flake dispersions in sodium cholate and NMP, having
no oxidation and low density of basal defects, judging
by the low ID/IG Raman band ratio.[98] Exfoliation
rates exceeding 5 g/hwere demonstrated using a 300 L
system and exfoliating rates of 100 g/hwere extrapo-
lated to 104 L high shear apparatus. Through several
combinations of diameters and rotor speeds,
it was
noted that graphene flakes could be produced at rele-
vant concentrations/yields if a minimum of 104 s 1
shear rate is attained, independently if the regime is
laminar or turbulent (discriminated by a Reynolds
number of 104). Hence,
the exfoliation mechanism
should be similar in both cases; nevertheless, turbulent
regimes characterized by higher Reynolds numbers
should in principle produce higher magnitude shear
stresses,
thus
for
enhanced yields.

An apparent disadvantage of high-shear exfoliation
using rotor/stator is that the desired high shear rates
are not uniformly distributed in all regions of the
exfoliating media, being rather concentrated near the
stator orifices and rotor-stator gap.[60,103]
In this
sense, high Reynolds numbers within the fluid are
desirable because the developed turbulence homoge-
nizes shear stresses within the exfoliation container.
An obvious and easily accessible choice for this pur-
pose are kitchen blenders equipped with rotating
authors.[101,102,104]
blades,
Commonly to ball stirring, shear force is not the only
mechanism responsible for exfoliation in rotor-stator
and rotating blade apparatus; it is aided by inter-flake
collisions, as well as interactions with the rotor/blade
such as flake edge collisions and cavitation,[103] with a
possible
differences
induced by turbulence.[101] The high-speed rotating
blade apparatus can produce enough shear stress for
graphene exfoliation in all volume of the container,
despite an obvious decrease of these stresses as the
distance from the blade increases. Hence, using rotat-
ing blades seemingly ensures that shear stresses will
dominate exfoliation at larger regions of the system

A more recent approach makes use of Taylor vor-
tex flows to promote high-shear stress exfoliation of
graphene,[105] denominated as Taylor–Couette flow.
The apparatus comprises two concentric cylinders that
are able to rotate independently and a graphite disper-
sion in an appropriate fluid contained between them
(Figure 4(c)). If
the inner cylinder rotation speed
reaches a critical value whilst the outer one is held at
rest, this special type of flow pattern can form, result-
ing in steady state axisymmetric toroidal vortices.
These vortices pose strong shear forces and pressure
gradients to the graphite precursors, leading to FLG
production at yields of up to 5%. The authors have
claimed a low oxidation degree and a low defect con-
centration of graphene via XPS and Raman spectros-
copy. Nevertheless,
the method used for inferring
oxidation is not unequivocal. More studies are needed
on this type of exfoliation, namely on the quality and
characteristics of the produced graphene and on the
possible
indus-
trial production.

Advantageously, no compound intercalating steps
are needed for high shear exfoliation, such as in elec-
trochemical (described below) or some ball milling
exfoliation routes, despite some attempts to combine
both, using electrochemical intercalation of tetrabuty-
lammonium tetrafluoroborate, resulting in stable gra-
phene dispersions in NMP with yields of up to
16%.[106] In addition, this type of shear exfoliation
provides higher yields compared to ball milling
because the graphite precursors move within the exfo-
liating media and can be continuously exposed to the
shear forces, thus increasing exfoliation efficiency.[60]
As a result, exfoliation rates are enhanced and proc-
essing times are significantly decreased, typically down
to a few hours or less. Additionally, final product con-
centrations of up to about 1 g/L were reported, e.g., in
aqueous solutions of PVP and sodium cholate surfac-
tant[107] or even in household dishwashing liquids at a
rate of up to 0.15 g/h.[102] It is also significant that,
for similar exfoliation energy density, the exfoliation
yield of shear stress using fluid dynamics can be about
one order of magnitude larger when compared to
purely sonication routes.[58,60,91,98] Finally, an increase
of the processing time in shear stress leads to a lin-
early proportional increase in graphene product for-
mation,[98,108] whilst in sonication routes a saturation
tendency is observed.[64,109] Unsurprisingly, high-shear

recently the effect of the viscosity of the exfoliating
media on the produced graphene characteristics and
yield was more systematically addressed,[110] despite
some older studies using solvents/surfactants with dif-
ferent viscosities.[103] This is an example demonstrat-
ing that many features of the process are still lacking
optimization. Furthermore, it is important to check if
high yields, quality, and fast production times of gra-
phene flakes are maintained in very large containers.
Moreover, similarly to other liquid-phase exfoliation

techniques, it matters to demonstrate the production
of stable graphene dispersions using nontoxic and
cheaper solvents at similar figures of merit compared
to strong organic solvents (e.g., NMP, DMSO, and
DMF, among others), ionic liquids or common surfac-
tant aqueous solutions (e.g., SDS, SDBS and PVP).[99]
Pure water would be the optimal solution, due to its
nontoxicity and low cost, but this is hindered by the
hydrophobic nature of graphene. In this sense,[103] the
use of IPA aqueous solutions yielding graphene dis-
persions of up to 0.27 g/Lin one hour high-shear proc-
essing has been reported, which tended to be stable
for up to 25 days after initial dispersion. Nevertheless,
the stability is found to be highly dependent on the
size and thickness of the graphene flakes. Other types
of nontoxic dispersants are being unveiled for liquid-
phase exfoliation of graphene and other 2D materials,
such as nontoxic, cost-effective nonionic polymers,[107]

or the so-called green dispersants (e.g., black tea,[104]
alkaline lignin,[90] black liquor).[108] The latter,
for
example, resulted in FLG dispersions of up to 10 g/L,
via shear stress mixing, providing a yield of about
18% after 10 h of process time.[108] More studies
within these approaches are needed to pave the way
toward the environmental-friendly and cost-effective
industrial production of graphene flakes using shear
stress exfoliation. Table 3 summarizes some of the

2.2.4. Electrochemical exfoliation
The production of graphene via
electrochemical
exfoliation is based on the physical deformation of a
graphitic working electrode immersed in an appropri-
ate electrolyte, via the exchange of an electric current.
The experimental setup also comprises a counter
(auxiliary) electrode against which the potential of the
working electrode is applied, ideally providing a large
surface area and low electrical resistance. The counter
electrode should also be chemically inert (e.g., plat-
inum) in order to avoid the production of species that
could interfere with the graphene exfoliation process,
but some recent approaches rely on the exfoliation of
both electrodes in order to improve the yield.[113–115]
In terms of industrial production, electrochemical
exfoliation of graphene provides several advantages
over other exfoliation types such as sonication or
purely chemical procedures. In general,
it encom-
passes simple, economically viable processes requiring
no
conditions.
Furthermore, it permits obtaining graphene with lat-
eral sizes of tens of micrometers,[116,117] yields larger
than 50 wt% and quantities up to a few grams in rela-
tively short production times (e.g., a few hours versus
days in chemical exfoliation and sonication).[64,109,117]
It has been shown that he applied potential is a crit-
ical parameter, through which it is possible to tune
not only the quantity of the produced graphene, but
also its quality. For instance, it has a profound impact
on the degree of oxidation of the products.[58,118,119]
Hence, a third (reference or pseudo-reference) elec-
trode is often employed (Figure 5(a)), through which
negligible current
is withdrawn, providing a stable
potential to accurately and stably control the potential
applied to the working electrode. Finally, it is a versa-
tile technique that can be combined with other
approaches such as sonication,[117,121] microwave proc-
essing,[118] and shear stress[122] to increase the yield,
although this poses some restrictions in terms of pro-
duction scale-up and industrialization. The main

temperature/pressure

disadvantages are common to sonication and high shear
stress exfoliation, such as the lack of widely available,
cheap, and “green” solvents needed to efficiently per-
form exfoliation and properly disperse the products. In
this sense, NaOH/H2O2/H2O solutions are promising in
terms of exfoliation efficiency, but
the products still
need to be posteriorly stabilized in surfactants.[123]
Finally, electrochemical exfoliation also suffers from a
high degree of size polydispersity, requiring posterior
purification or separation.[117,124,125]

The general exfoliation principle is that the applied
ionic species
voltage promotes the intercalation of
in the electrolyte in between the graphite
present
leading to physical deformation and an
layers,
increase in the interlayer distance, thus weakening the
Van der Walls forces and culminating with the separ-
ation of graphene layers (Figure 5(a)).[117] Two main
types of electrochemical exfoliation of graphene exist
depending on whether the electrode is anodically or
cathodically driven. In anodic (cathodic) exfoliation

charged, promoting the intercalation of anions (cati-
ons). Anodic exfoliation provides faster and higher-
yield graphene exfoliation at lower applied potentials
when compared to cathodic exfoliation. In general,
anodic exfoliation makes use of a variety of aqueous
or organic
ionic
liquids.[133] In particular, the usage of both organic
and inorganic salts as intercalating agents has been
attracting great attention, and recent studies[134] point
out sodium pyrophosphate and sodium phosphate as
better exfoliating agents than sodium citrate, the for-
mer greatly enhancing the yield and allowing to
obtain graphene with a reduced number of layers, but
also with increased defect content. However, organic
salts such as sodium citrate are also promising due to
better
inor-
ganic salts.[135]

In many cases,

intercalation and exfoliation is
attained using a constant voltage, the magnitude of
which varies greatly among the literature, mainly
influenced by the
electrolyte properties and the
desired characteristics of the graphene (see Table 4).
The intercalated ions can undergo a change into the
gas state, which enhances the exfoliation process by
increasing structural deformation, e.g., via the forma-
tion of O2/CO2
In this
sense, a commonly employed strategy is to use aque-
ous solutions of sulfates.[116,137] Parvez et al.[137] ana-
lyzed several sulfate compounds in the exfoliation
process and found up to 85% of graphene having
three or
layers. According to the authors,

hydroxyl ions from water reduction attack preferen-
tially the graphite edges and grain boundaries, where
expansion starts promoting the intercalation of sulfate
ions and H2O. Afterwards, sulfate ions and water mol-
ecules undergo reduction and oxidation,
leading to
the production of SO2 and O2 that assist the exfoli-
ation process.

The major obstacle often observed using bulky
graphite electrodes lies in the inherent mechanism of
exfoliation. Since the electrode is physically deformed
during intercalation, it may start disintegrating, creat-
ing thick graphite flakes that are no longer electro-
chemically active by lack of electrical contact with the
electrode. This is the main reason justifying the need
for posterior thinning of the graphitic products via
sonication.[116,129,137,155,156] A potential breakthrough
to solve this problem whilst maintaining good scal-
ability prospects is the use of physical compression of
the graphite,[116] taking place within a permeable and

compressible container. Authors have shown appre-
ciable yields of 38%, which could theoretically be
improved to 65%, but the large-scale production with
this figure of merit is yet to be demonstrated.

The formation of

thick flakes occurs especially
when employing acid electrolytes, because of
the
higher anion intercalation rate in such conditions.[156]
Moreover,
the products often denote an important
degree of overoxidation.[117,156,157] In this sense, the
usage of inorganic salts at neutral pH[137] has been
also proposed in order to control anion intercalation,
seemingly allowing the production of good quality
and thin exfoliated graphene. The addition of antioxi-
dant species to the electrolyte also enhances carbon to
oxygen content ratio.[140,158] Nevertheless, the major
issue is that, in general, anodic-based processes using
aqueous solutions at the potentials required for suc-
cessful anion intercalation also lead to water hydroly-
sis. This culminates with low yields, severe oxidation

defects and/or other undesired functionalization, the
extent of which depends mainly on the applied poten-
tial and on the pH of the electrolyte.

An alternative approach relies on the application of
multi-potential programs, as opposed to the trad-
itional constant potential process.[117,123,127,138,139] A
better control in the intercalation process leading to
the
(e.g.,
<3 nm)[138] was reported. Recently, Chen et al.[127]
employed different potential sweep profiles between 7
and 10 V, followed by deintercalation steps at  0.5 V,
in 0.1 M (NH4)2SO4 solutions. A sinusoidal profile
more than doubled the average area of the products,
and an increase of 9% up to 96% of graphene with
less than 5 layers was also obtained. Without
the
 0.5 V step, that percentage decreased to about 60%.
Authors claimed that the potential sweeps, especially
sinusoidal ones, greatly reduced the oxidative breaking
the graphite basal C¼ C bonds and promoted
of
2  intercalation in comparison with fixed potential
SO4
approaches, by equilibrating these two kinetically dis-
similar processes. On the other hand, at  0.5 V the
basal plane disruption and anion intercalation is hin-
dered, and anion release from in between the graphite
layers is promoted. This allows a more controlled
interlayer expansion and exfoliation, yielding higher
surface area graphene with fewer layers and less
defects. Despite the merits, the final optimized prod-
ucts still denote a considerable degree of oxidation as
shown via XPS.

Despite the above-mentioned efforts to control the
anodic exfoliation, cathodically-driven exfoliation is
conceptually preferable to obtain higher structural
quality graphene, mainly because cathodic processes
avoid the formation of graphene oxide.[118] Cathodic
exfoliation is, in general, achieved using organic sol-
vents or ionic liquids, because the insertion of aque-
ous cations into graphite is a slow and inefficient
process,[118] limited at higher potentials by the hydro-
gen evolution reaction.[115] Ionic liquids are an inter-
esting approach because of their tunable miscibility
and viscosity, recyclability, high electrical conductivity,
large electrochemical windows and surface energies
compatible with graphene.[124,159]

On the other hand, Li ions have been known for
decades to intercalate graphite, and this fact was used
to

Nevertheless, Li ion insertion is a slow, inhomogen-
eous process[117,160] that limits the yield, in most cases
also requiring post-sonication to obtain a satisfactory
exfoliation of graphene. The sluggish kinetics can be
sped up by increasing the applied voltage magnitude,

such as  30 V,[151] versus 1 to 10 V in anodic exfoli-
ation (although reports exist using higher potentials,
see Table 4). Nevertheless, this comes at the expense
of energy efficiency via competing decomposition of
solvent cations,[152,161] lack of control over the charac-
teristics of
the produced graphene, with increased
defect content and unwanted contaminations. There
are, however, other compounds that can be cathodi-
cally intercalated into graphite. Naþ/DMSO complexes
with the aid of thionin acetate salt in aqueous solu-
tions were shown to be viable intercalants, but still
post-sonication was necessary.[121] Cathodic exfoli-
ation at low potentials ( 4 V to  5 V) using tetraal-
kylammonium salts has been shown to yield few layer
graphene products with minimal oxygen content and
without
the need for any subsequent exfoliation
steps,[120] which is one of the most impressive results
in the literature on cathodic
exfoliation (Figure
5(b–e)). Interestingly, little to none graphite expansion
is seen using Li-based electrolyte as a comparison.

Some authors have put efforts to combine both
anodic and cathodic exfoliation of graphite electrodes
in the same run, either through application of alter-
nating positive/negative DC pulses,[113] AC pulses[114]
or employing electrolytes allowing both anionic and
cationic intercalation,[115] including ionic liquids.[149]
Contrarily to purely anodic or cathodic exfoliation,
these strategies allow for exfoliation of both the work-
ing and counter (graphite) electrodes. Using the latter
approach, graphene was produced in tetrabutylammo-
nium perchlorate (TBAClO4) in propylene carbonate,
which provides a potential window large enough for

respectively.[115] A posterior thermal treatment enhan-
ces interlayer expansion via transition of the interca-
lated ions to gas state. The obtained yield is admirable
(see Table 4), but extensive temperature treatments,
post sonication and repeated wash by vacuum filtra-
tion and centrifugation were necessary, so that the
process is hardly two-step. In addition, the influence
of the sonication on the final product quality and
yield is unclear.
AC signals (±10 V, 0.1 Hz) in 0.1 M tetra-n-butylam-
monium bisulfate (TBAHSO4) have been proposed to
achieve
exfoli-
ation.[114] The authors claimed outstanding yields (see
Table 4) and the low defect density of the products was
attributed to both the higher intrinsic quality of cathodic
exfoliation and the reduction of anodic graphene via the
AC signal. The mechanism involves the initial oxygen
radicals formation during the anodic process, which

attack graphite grain boundaries and defects preferen-
tially, opening gaps for the consequent intercalation of
sulfate ions. The sulfate ions are reduced at the cathodic
counterpart forming SO2 gas bubbles, which expand the
graphite and allow the bigger TBAþ ions to intercalate,
expanding the graphite even further. Interestingly, little
exfoliation at
the cathode was observed when using
ammonium sulfate. However, in other work, exfoliation
could be accomplished simultaneously at both graphite
electrodes using alternating DC pulses of ± 10 V in
solutions.[113] The

the exfoliation efficiency.

Despite the recent progress,

further studies are
needed in order to establish electrochemical exfoli-
ation as a definite alternative for scalable graphene
production, preferentially without the aid of post-son-
ication or other co-assisting routes. Such should be
accomplished using cheap,
environmental-friendly,
and widely available chemicals, which still remains
a challenge.

There are multiple routes to prepare GO, most

methods, a stable colloidal
suspension of GO is
achieved. The first example of oxidizing graphite
came when Brodie employed a combination of potas-
sium chlorate (KClO3) and nitric acid (HNO3) in his
investigations to study the chemistry of graphite.[162]
As a result of these studies, a new material was devel-
oped, dispersible in pure or regular water, which he
named “graphic acid.” In the late 19th century,
Staudenmaier improved Brodie’s process by adding
H2SO4 to the combination and by adding KClO3
throughout the reaction rather than in a single add-
ition.[163] Nearly 60 years later, Hummers used a com-
bination
(KMnO4),
sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and H2SO4 to oxidize graph-
ite,[164] while Hofmann’s method involved oxidation

oxygen ratio would vary from 1.17 to 0.74 in
Staudenmaier to Tour methods, respectively.[167] The
most common source of graphite used for these
chemical methods is flake graphite. The localized
defects in the p-structure may serve as starting sites of
the oxidation process.[168] Depending on the oxidation
process,
functional
groups, such as carboxyl (C¼ O), hydroxyl (C – OH)
and epoxide (C – O), form on the surface and around
the edges of the graphene layers, making them hydro-
philic and reducing the interlayer forces. Depending

1.2 nm.[169] These interlayer
spacings weaken the
interactions between the GO sheets and facilitate the
exfoliation process. The GO is then exfoliated in the
aqueous media via mechanical stirring, rapid heating
or sonification to separate the layers of GO.[170]
Currently,
the Hummers method and its modified
versions[166,171,172] are the most commonly employed
methods to synthesize GO.

The

common methods of preparing GO
involve direct oxidation of graphene layers via atomic
oxygen in ultrahigh vacuum conditions,[173] photo-
chemical reaction in ultraviolet light and oxygen,[174]
or oxidation in nitric
acid under potentiostatic
conditions.[175]

Due to its disrupted sp2 bonding network, GO
is an electrical insulator (with electrical conductivity
<1 lS/m). This disruption is also reflected in the
Raman spectra of GO, which present broadened char-
acteristic peaks,
low I2D/IG intensity ratios and a
prominent D peak (Figure 6(a)). In order to increase
the electrical conductivity of these 2D nanomaterials,
GO can be reduced by a strong chemical reduc-
tant[176] or thermal reduction,[177] which results in the
formation of rGO (Figure 6(b)). As a result of the

restored and recovers most of the electrical conductiv-
ity. The thermal properties are also improved as a
result of the reduction process.[178] However, due to
the residual oxygen functional groups, rGO does not
exhibit the same electrical properties as those of pure
graphene. Although the reduction process can bring
GO’s optical and electrical properties closer to those
of pristine graphene, it is still not enough to heal the
vacancy defects.[179] One should note, however, that
certain application can benefit from the presence of
oxygen-containing functional groups. In the context
of water purification, a prominent example of a
potential practical application of GO,

layer spacing in GO membranes, allowing capillary
permeation of water through two-dimensional chan-
nels formed between the layers while maintaining
impermeability toward gases such as He.[180] Such
behavior has led to an increased interest in the use of
GO membranes not only in water purification, but
also in gas separation applications.[181]

2.4. Other production methods

A method with potential to produce graphene with
medium to high quality in moderate quantities relies
on the atmospheric synthesis by microwave-sustained
plasmas. This method was reported for the first time
by Dato et al.[182] In this approach, the use of a sub-
strate or a catalyst is not necessary, as the nucleation
and growth of the graphene flakes take place within
the gas phase. Complicated vacuum fixtures are also
avoided in this open-air graphene synthesis alterna-
tive. The principle of the synthesis consists in the
decomposition of the carbon precursor organic com-
pounds (ex. ethanol) in a dense microwave argon
plasma and the subsequent radical rearrangement into
sp2 coordinated carbon, along with CO and H2 gas-
eous by-products. The material
thus obtained is a
‘fluffy’ dark powder constituted by graphene sheets
that show good structural quality when characterized
by Raman, XPS and electron microscopy techniques,
matching or even exceeding the best grade quality of
liquid-phase exfoliated graphene.[183]

Although the yield of the process is pointed out as
its major disadvantage, growth rates as high as 2 mg/
min have been reported in a surface wave induced
based
IR/UV

assisted with

reactor

(surfatron)

radiation excitation applied at the “cold” outlet gas
flow section.[184] In fact, this does not scale as well as
much higher throughput methods like liquid-phase
exfoliation, but considering the higher structural qual-
ity of the atmospheric plasma graphene deposits, this
technique may become an option.

Alternatively to the standard atmospheric micro-
wave plasma torch set up in the seminal work by
Dato et al.,[183] there are at least three types of reac-
tors capable of depositing graphene, mainly differing
in terms of
the configuration through which the
microwave plasma is sustained.

i.

Surfatron: a surfatron-based setup consists in
creating a surface wave induced microwave con-
figuration that
enables maintaining a stable
plasma in atmospheric pressure conditions.

ii. TIAGO: a device constituted by a waveguide,
whose central section is reduced in height, and a
cylindrical hollow metallic rod placed perpen-
dicularly, producing a jet conical flame plasma
surrounded by the air around it.

iii. Microwave slot antenna: a simple set up that
allows initiating and maintaining atmospheric
plasmas in H2/Ar mixtures.

Since this approach to produce graphene is rela-
tively new, in the last years more groups have been
devoting their workforce to the development of this
technique.[185–187] Therefore,
is not
yet disclosed, and it is expected that graphene pro-
duced by microwave atmospheric plasmas will be
soon reported embodying different applications, rang-
ing from nanocomposites and energy storage devices
to water purification or drug delivery systems.[183]

Laser processing is a powerful tool explored in dif-
ferent processes, since it
is a rapid and efficient
method to produce complex structures at different
scales. Thus, nowadays, laser technology is being used
to produce graphene-based materials, since there is a
strong demand for cost-effective fabrication of gra-
phene patterns with low energy consumption in a
short fabrication time (Figure 7(a)). This novel one-
step process was developed, in 2014, by Tour’s group,
and allows to obtain porous graphene-based structures
through the incidence of a laser beam on a polymeric
sheet at atmospheric conditions[188] (Figure 7(b)). The
laser-induced graphene (LIG) technique enables to
transform sp3 carbon present in the polymeric sub-
strate into sp2 carbon[188] (Figure 7(c)). Laser irradi-

laser sources (UV laser,[190] visible
using different
laser)[191] and carbon precursor materials
(wood,
food, cork, paper, among others).[192,193]

Figure 7(b) shows that LIG has the appearance of a
foam with a percolation network of porous multi-layer
graphenes, which is associated with the localized high
temperature and pressure produced by laser irradi-
ation. The image puts in evidence the very high sur-
face area of this material, comparable to that of the
wet-chemistry derived 3D graphene.[192]

This direct laser writing process has emerged as a
facile method enabling the synthesis of flexible, pat-
ternable and scalable graphene-based structures, and
has many advantages, such as nontoxicity and control-
lability, envisioning large-scale catalyst free non-con-
tact production and maskless patterning. In fact, LIG
has become a multifunctional graphene foam, with
many applications having been explored since it was
discovered in 2014, such as: supercapacitors for energy
storage devices,[188] electrochemical biosensors,[194,195]

and

In another example of graphene production by
laser, graphene films were obtained by coating a Ni
substrate with graphite nanoparticles,
followed by
the coated surface.[198] Carbon
laser irradiation of
atoms from the graphite particles dissolve into Ni
bulk under the action of laser-induced heating, and,
subsequently, precipitate onto the surface, where the
graphene film is
formed. The obtained material
presents Raman spectra characteristic of high crystal-
line quality graphene, with SLG accounting for 25% of
the overall area of the film.

Novel and innovative ways of producing graphene
are still arising in the literature. One outstanding
example is that of Tour’s group, who used a technique
similar to flash sintering to produce graphene from
organic waste in a fast and inexpensive way, with
yields of 1 g per batch.[199]

Corrosion, the gradual degradation of metals and alloys
as a result of chemical and/or electrochemical reactions
with the surrounding environment, has an undeniable
impact in terms of ecological health and economic loss.
Material deteriorates, appearance is significantly altered,
mechanical properties are lost and eventually the
affected metallic parts end up losing their functionality.
Protecting such structures
therefore, of utmost
importance.[14] Coating technology is among the pleth-
ora of approaches developed to provide protection to
metallic surfaces and improve their quality. In addition
to passive barrier properties and esthetic appearance,
coating formulations can serve other functional pur-
poses, such as an active self-healing action triggered by
specific stimuli. When it comes to corrosion preven-
tion, the key requirements of an ideal barrier coating
system include an inherent resistance to degradation in
hostile conditions, an effective resistance toward the
permeation of corrosive agents and mechanical integ-
rity over the desired life of the coated components.
Conventional anti-corrosion coating technologies that
involve, for instance, the use of hexavalent chromium
connote a negative environmental impact given the car-
cinogenic risk of such compounds.[200] Furthermore,
traditional approaches reveal several
limitations, such
as susceptibility to damage by heat,
limited chemical
stability, potentialy high cost and the possibility of
altering the physical properties of the metals being pro-
tected. Hence, there is a need for a disruptive eco-

graphene

Graphene has emerged as a promising candidate
due to its remarkable set of properties arisen from its
unique structure. Being the barrier effect one of the
most relevant characteristics in a multilayer system,
much attention has been devoted to such material by
virtue of its impermeability to fluids and gases. Apart
from preventing the transport of corrosive or oxidative
species toward the underlying substrate without notably
altering its thermal conductivity and optical properties,
graphene-based films enable a reduction of the applied
layer in terms of quantity and volume. Besides, because
of its chemical inertness, particularly regarding oxida-
tion, graphene is highly resistant to corrosion in condi-
tions under which other substances would undergo
chemical transformations. However, despite this excep-
tional combination of features, the application of gra-
phene in corrosion science appeared inconceivable, at
first, since it was exclusively obtained via mechanical
exfoliation, a low throughput, non-scalable method that
renders
0.1 mm.
Nonetheless, the discovery that not even the smallest
atoms of helium can penetrate the dense lattice struc-
ture of graphene,[10] along with the first large-area syn-
theses of such material on copper substrates through
CVD,[24] significantly altered this scenario. The seminal
research conducted by Chen et al.,[203] in turn, can be
considered the major turning point in the application
of graphene as an anti-corrosive coating. Chen and
coworkers unequivocally demonstrated,
for the first
time, the ability of CVD-grown graphene layers to pro-
tect refined metals in hostile environments over rela-
tively short periods. Even though the early studies on
the utilization of graphene in the field of corrosion pre-
vention emerged later than those in other engineering
fields, the number of citations is increasing at an accel-
erating pace, reflecting the quickly growing interest of
corrosion scientists and engineers in this multipurpose
material.[12,14,202,204] Research on graphene-based anti-
corrosion technologies can be split into two generalized
groups, pure graphene anti-corrosive coatings and
composite
coatings. The
achievements regarding both types were reviewed by
Tong et al.,[204] for example.

environments,
applying both graphene and graphene oxide films as
a protective layer due to their barrier effect. Several
studies showed the benefit of applying graphene
layers on the surface of metals, such as nickel alloys,
copper alloys and steel.[205–207] The protective gra-
phene layer could be prepared directly on the metal
surface via methods such as CVD, electrophoretic
deposition (EPD) and laser fabrication methods,[198]
or could be transferred to the surface using a mech-
anical transfer technology. Among all the preparation
techniques, CVD is the most commonly used method
due to its simplicity, quality of the film and the abil-
ity to coat large areas.[13] The distance between the
graphene film and the metal substrate largely affects
the bonding strength between the graphene and the
metal, and the graphene films prepared on different
metals show different structures. It has been reported
that the strength between the carbon atoms and cop-
per, nickel and cobalt is weaker compared to gold,
silver, and palladium.[208] Therefore, other techniques
such as mechanical transfer have been reported to be
applied to coat any metal materials with high-quality
graphene films.

Anisur et al.[209] prepared graphene films on the
surface of nickel via a CVD method and investigated
the role of hydrogen flow and the cooling rate during
graphene growth on the barrier properties and defect
density of the film. Electrochemical impedance spec-
troscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic tests on the sam-
ples immersed in a 0.1 M NaCl solution showed that
graphene coatings prepared on Ni in an environment
without H2 flow offer nearly one order of magnitude
superior corrosion resistance than that of uncoated
Ni. SEM revealed that the hydrogen flow during the
graphene growth facilitated wrinkle formation, result-
ing in a similar corrosion resistance to the uncoated
Ni. Ye et al.[198] prepared graphene on Ni substrates,
using a laser fabrication method at room temperature,
showing the possibility of
large-area
graphene films with superior anti-corrosion perform-
ance compared to the bare substrate.

fabrication of

In the study of Pu et al.,[207] a CVD method was
used to coat stainless steel and nickel-plated stainless
steel with graphene films. The SEM analysis showed
100% graphitization of the nickel-plated stainless steel,
while for the stainless steel sample the SEM images
showed a poor coverage of the graphene film on the
substrate surface. The polarization curves also showed
that the corrosion currents of the graphene coated
nickel-plated stainless steel sample were one fifth of
the bare nickel-plated stainless steel. In order to elim-
inate the complications of
transferring grown gra-
phene films to another substrate, different preparation
techniques were applied in other studies. Ye et al.[210]
employed a laser alloying process to form a Ni/Fe
layer on the surface of carbon steel, followed by the
growth of graphene films via laser irradiation. Anti-
corrosion performance, including the results of polar-
ization and EIS in 3.5% NaCl (aq) solutions, showed a
significant improvement in the corrosion resistance of
carbon steel, which is even superior to stainless steel.
In another study, Quezada-Renterıa et al.[211] applied
the EPD technique to grow rGO films as an anti-cor-
rosive coating on carbon steel, which showed a reduc-
tion of up to three times in the corrosion rate
compared to the bared carbon steel.

Tiwari et al.[212] prepared graphene films on a copper
surface using the CVD method. In order to increase the
corrosion protection ability of
the graphene films, a
multilayer graphene coating was prepared. In this study
a significant corrosion resistance in a 0.1 M NaCl solu-
tion was observed and the corrosion resistance was sus-
tained for longer durations. This study showed that
multilayer graphene could be effective in blocking the
pathways of corrosive species to the metal surface. Raza

et al.[213] prepared GO films on copper substrates via an
EPD method. The results showed control of coating
thickness by varying the GO/water suspension concen-
trations and the voltage in the EPD process. EIS results
also showed that the corrosion rate of GO film covered
copper was six times lower than that of bare copper in
0.6 M NaCl solution. Hsieh et al.[214] applied the atomic
layer deposition (ALD) technique to grow graphene
films on copper to eliminate the structural defects in
CVD-grown graphene, which resulted in an inhibition
efficiency of more than 99%.

The main mechanism which allows graphene and
graphene-based films and coatings to significantly
reduce the corrosion rate of copper, nickel, and steel
in aggressive solutions is the barrier effect (Figure
8(a)). The contact between the graphene film and the
metal substrate makes it difficult for reactive agents
such as oxygen and water to reach the metal surface.
Thus, in order to have a long-lasting corrosion resist-
ance and a high-quality film with a complete barrier
effect, the film needs to fully cover the metal surface.
There should also be a good adhesion between the
graphene film and the substrate, with high resistance
to wear and friction.

applications

Nonetheless, although there are several

reports
showing promising results on the corrosion resistance
of graphene-coated metals, recent studies have shown
that graphene-coated metals could corrode at even
greater rates than bare metals.[215] These considerable
variations in results arise due to the lack of complete
surface coverage, th the presence of defects including
wrinkles and cracks.[216,217] These defects are also the
main reason for poor corrosion resistance in long-last-
ing
(Figure 8(b)). Therefore, many
researchers proposed that it was not practical to con-
sider graphene films as a corrosion protective layer
for long-term applications due to the difficulties in
avoiding defects in the preparation process.[218] There
are other studies that tried to improve the protective
ability of the graphene films by repairing the defects
via an atomic layer precipitation technology.[214] Some
researchers have also shown that due to the high elec-
trical conductivity of graphene it promotes electro-
chemical corrosion of metals.[215] It has been shown
that
in the damaged regions, graphene and metal
form corrosion microcells. In such cases, metals such
as copper, nickel, aluminum, magnesium,
iron, or
steel, act as the anode, promoting galvanic corrosion.
In addition, the as-grown graphene layers are charac-
terized by low adherence to the subjacent metal as a
consequence of weak interaction.[200,202] Although

commercialization of
graphene-based coatings. The first studies of gra-
phene-based composite coatings date from around
2012,[219] and since then such films have been applied
to a broad range of substrates, such as aluminum,
steel, brass and copper. The preparation methodology
and coating procedure of such materials can be estab-
lished based on the traditional coating production
processes with controllable workability. The most rele-
vant coating methodologies include lamination,[220]
physical deposition or dispersion and subsequent cur-
ing,[221,222] self-assembly,
layer-by-layer (LbL) depos-
ition and the sol-gel method.[200]

4.1. Dispersion in polymeric matrices

In coating applications, graphene and its derivatives
have stood out as efficient fillers in polymer matrices
to form hybrid films. Polymer nanocomposites pro-
vide superior features at a relatively low cost and the
processing procedure is less complex when compared
to multilayer coating systems. Moreover, polymer/gra-
phene hybrids address other problematic issues, such
as galvanic corrosion.[14,204] By utilizing graphene or
its derivatives as nanometric fillers in the polymeric
matrix, it is possible to lengthen the diffusion pathway
of the corrosion medium in the coatings by taking
advantage of its chemical inertness and barrier prop-
erties.[13] Graphene has heretofore been combined
with a wide variety of polymeric materials, such as
epoxy (EP),[223–253] polyurethane (PU),[254–259] polya-
alkyd,[263] polystyrene
niline
(PS),[264] PMMA,[265,266] polyvinyl butyral
(PVB)
and[267,268] polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).[269]

(PANI),[227,233,260–262]

The lack of functional groups on the surface of
pure graphene,
its high surface area (and, conse-
quently, high surface energy) and the Van der Waals
interactions pose major challenges for the dispersion
of graphene as filler particles in coating matrices,
resulting in poor compatibility. Such factors contrib-

undermines its corrosion resistance. The inclusion of
graphene fillers in polymer matrices aims at hamper-
ing the diffusion of corrosive species through the
coating, thus enhancing its barrier effect. However,
their agglomeration has quite the opposite effect by
providing direct diffusion pathways
through the
matrix. Thus, improving the dispersibility of graphene
must be an utmost priority when developing gra-
phene/polymer nanocomposites. And even though
some researchers have simply incorporated unmodi-
fied graphene in polymeric matrices by way of phys-
ical means[224] or
the
results were not considered ideal and such methods
have proven suitable only for GO and rGO, due to
the presence of epoxy and carboxyl groups on its sur-
face.[271] To achieve improved dispersibility, two main
(often complementary) approaches can be identified
(Figure 9): mechanical dispersion and dispersion
through chemical modification. The latter aims to
affect the interaction between graphene or graphene-
based materials and the polymeric matrix. These inter-
actions
covalent or non-covalent.
Moreover, decoration with nanoparticles is also com-
mon, often taking advantage of the modified interac-
tions. In the context of mechanical dispersion, Chang
et al.,[266]
for example, prepared thermally reduced
graphene oxides with varying carboxylic-group con-
tent, and found that higher amounts of carboxyl
groups appeared to enhance the compatibility of these
rGOs with the acrylic resin, thus improving their dis-
persion in the PMMA matrix. On the other hand, the

simple mechanical dispersion of unmodified single-
layered GO in epoxy resin required vigorous mechan-
ical mixing and intense sonication processes in order
to effectively deagglomerate the GO sheets.[235]

The structural and chemical modification of graphene
and graphene-based materials is among the most com-
monly used approaches to stabilize suspensions of such
material in complex environments without agglomeration
taking place. Surface functionalization can play an
important role in achieving good interfacial bonding
between graphene sheets and the surrounding matrices.
Graphane, the fully hydrogenated analogue of graphene,
was one of the first chemically modified graphene deriva-
tives.[272,273] Aside from hydrogenation,
the controlled
oxidation of graphite flakes to generate hydrophilic GO
and its selective reduction into hydrophobic rGO are also
among the simplest routes to introduce surface functional
groups onto graphene layers.[200] The chemical modifica-
tion of graphene usually involves the use of coupling
agents, such as silanes[239,240,244,246,252,256,257] and other
dispersants.[219,225–231,241,242,253,255,258,260,264,269]

Generally, such additives contain both hydrophilic and
organophilic functional groups, which can be combined
with inorganic filler particles and organic coating matrices
respectively. As a result, these compounds are able to
improve the quality of the matrix/filler interactions and,
consequently, enhance the overall performance of gra-
phene/polymer composites.[12] The anti-corrosion proper-

sive species. Table 5 compiles some of the most relevant
research studies on the surface modification of graphene
and its derivatives, either by coupling agents or other
chemical reagents, over the past few years.

The synthesis of graphene-nanoparticle composites
(G-NPs) is another route to improve the dispersibility
of graphene-based materials in polymeric matrices
and ensure the integrity of
their structure. Several
nanoparticles have been utilized for such purpose, as
summarized in Table 6. In addition to their availabil-
ity, mechanical properties and photo and thermal sta-
bility—among other appealing characteristics—these
nanostructures increase the interlayer spacing between
GO sheets, preventing their aggregation,[248,250] and
may be employed to impart new functionalities to gra-
phene-based nanocomposites, as will be covered in
the following section. By taking advantage of the syn-

4.2. Functional incorporation in anti-

corrosion composites

Nearly all the above-mentioned works have reached a
unanimous conclusion: the superior performance of
the obtained graphene-based composite coatings is
unquestionably associated with the barrier effect pro-
vided by graphene or its derivatives. As previously
noted, the unique impervious 2D structure of gra-
phene imparts it with exceptional barrier properties
toward all fluids and gases. The extremely small pores
of its hexagonal
lattice ensure minimal permeability
even for the smallest atoms, i.e., He. Furthermore, the
dense and delocalized electron cloud of the p-conju-
gated carbon network in graphene blocks the gap
within its close packed aromatic rings and poses a
repelling field to reactive atoms or molecules, thus
providing a physical separation between the refined
metal surface and environmental reactants. Hence,
graphene can be understood as an impenetrable nano-
metric shield which can effectively isolate subjacent
metal surfaces from invasive agents without altering
their thermal conductivity and optical properties. By
prolonging the infiltration path of corrosive media
through the coating, graphene can greatly enhance its
corrosion resistance and extend its service life.[12,200]

Let us take as an example the investigation carried
out by Yu and coworkers[275] who exploited the
impermeable nature of graphene to create a high-per-
formance polymer/graphene sandwich-like anti-corro-
sive system. Given the paucity of reports on CVD-

grown graphene-based coatings able to provide long-
term protection of metals, the authors aimed at devel-
oping a hybrid structure consisting of alternating SLG
and PVB films on a commercial aerospace aluminum
alloy (AA2024-T3). After comparing the effect of
immersion in simulated seawater
on uncoated
AA2024, pure PVB-coated AA2024 and graphene/
PVB-coated AA2024,
the best electrochemical per-
formance was assigned to the hybrid coating made up
of two graphene layers sandwiched by three polymeric
films (PVB/SLG/PVB/SLG/PVB). Such system entirely
suppressed the deterioration of the aluminum sub-
strate, the surface of which remained unaltered for up
to 120 days of immersion in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. In
contrast, the graphene-free variants and the PVB/SLG/
PVB system were able to provide corrosion protection
only in the short-term (30 days), which clearly empha-
sized the dramatic improvement of the barrier proper-
ties of PVB coatings by inclusion of atomically thin
graphene layers. Thus, Yu and his team managed to
combine the adhesive and insulating properties of
polymer films with the imperviousness of CVD-grown

Fabricating impeccable, defect-free coatings is con-
sidered virtually impossible to achieve, since the for-
mation of cracks is often unavoidable during their
preparation. Such fissures pose menacing entry points
for corrosive media to invade the metal, and once the
aggressive species penetrate the metal,
its corrosion
resistance and structural integrity are jeopardized. If
crack extension occurs, more vulnerable areas will be
exposed, and severe localized corrosion may occur. In
addition to its ability to hinder the penetration of cor-
rosive agents through coatings due to its impermeable
nature, graphene can effectively increase their fracture
toughness, preventing crack propagation and the con-
sequential
substan-
ces.[236,276,277] The mechanisms underpinning the
effectiveness of graphene in hampering the expansion
of existing cracks mainly involve the consumption of

of

the crack growth energy. When the crack reaches the
graphene/matrix interface,
the crack tip stress will
cause
interfacial debonding. Microcracks will be
formed either around or in the graphene itself and
will consume a significant amount of the original frac-
ture energy. If external forces continue to intensify,
crack deflection may occur through the deteriorated
graphene. As the crack deviates from the original
expansion direction and the propagation path is
lengthened,
is
increased. Moreover, the addition of graphene to crys-
talline and semicrystalline polymers can also affect
their crystallization behavior, as shown by Zhang
et al.[278] They prepared a transparent poly(lactic acid)
(PLA) nanocomposite film reinforced with fully exfoli-
ated octadecylamine-functionalized graphene (ODAG)
as an effective nanofiller, by solution blending and
casting method. Given the good compatibility between
the two materials, ODAG could be uniformly dis-
persed in the PLA matrix and improved interfacial
adhesion was achieved. In comparison with neat PLA,
the obtained PLA/ODAG nanohybrid exhibited a 34%
increase in tensile strength, 44% increase in Young’s
modulus, and 300% improvement in tensile toughness
with the addition of only 0.4 wt% ODAG. The simul-
taneous
strength and
toughness could be attributed not only to the homo-
genous distribution of ODA-modified graphene across
the PLA matrix, but also to the enhanced crystalliza-
tion behavior of
the thermoplastic polymer. The
incorporation of ODAG facilitated the cold crystalliza-
tion process of PLA and notably improved its
crystallinity.

used APTES to chemically alter the surface of gra-

protection properties of an epoxy coating. Both were
effectively enhanced by the deposition of a functional-
ized GO (fGO) film on the surface of steel prior to
the application of
the subsequent organic coating.
Moreover, the cathodic delamination rate of the latter
was decreased. The same group also studied the effect
of 3-(Triethoxysilyl)propyl
isocyanate (TEPI)- and
APTES-functionalized GO nanofillers (IGO and AGO,
respectively) embedded in sol-gel based silane films
on the adhesion strength, corrosion protection and
cathodic disbanding of the outermost epoxy coating
applied on the silane-treated steel substrate.[280] While
the incorporation of non-functionalized GO displayed
no significant effect, the well-dispersed IGO and AGO
inclusions significantly improved the adhesion quality
and corrosion resistance of the topmost layer, due to
their excellent barrier properties, good compatibility

Additionally, the electrical conductivity surpassed 103

related to the charge carrier type, which changed from
p- to n-type with the increase in graphene content.
Such conversion was attributed to the doping effect

dependent with respect to rGO.

derivatives and metal oxides was also explored by

of the composite structure. In the latter case, a highly-
ordered Fe3O4-graphite nanosheets/epoxy composite
was obtained by tethering the magnetic nanoparticles
onto the surface of graphite nanoplatelets, by wet-
chemical precipitation method, and aligning the latter
in the epoxy resin under a low magnetic field. The
Fe3O4-modified graphite nanoplatelets were embedded
in the EP matrix in such a highly oriented manner
that its permeability dropped considerably and the gas
barrier properties increased one order of magnitude
compared to the blank EP and more than 65% com-
pared to the randomly arranged graphite nanoplate-
lets/EP specimens.

4.3. Composites for active corrosion protection

chemically treated graphene

The addition of
to
organic coatings can go beyond the mere improve-
ment in adhesion and passive barrier properties. By
intentionally altering graphene’s structure with,
for
instance, corrosion inhibitors, highly efficient protect-
ive coatings can be developed. In order to overcome
the presence of defects in epoxy coatings, metronida-
zole (MET)-modified graphene oxide nanocomposites
(GME) were synthesized via a two-step method that
involved grafting maleic anhydride (MA) on GO sur-
face (GM),[232] followed by the covalent attachment of
MET by the esterification mechanism. GME materials
were shown to enhance epoxy films’ corrosion protec-
tion performance at a low weight fraction of 0.2 wt%.
Given that MET could be released from the GME
hybrids and form an adsorption film, the scratched
specimens were able to self-repair the damaged areas
as a means to prolong the lifetime of the subjacent
metallic structure.

The adsorptive behavior of Urtica Dioica (U.D) leaf
extract on the graphene oxide nanosheets was exam-
ined by Nikpour et al.,[284] who investigated its influ-
ence on the corrosion inhibiting properties of an
epoxy film. The achieved results revealed that the add-
ition of GO-U.D and GO-U.Dþ Zn2þ to the epoxy
layer with an artificial defect improved the coating
resistance to corrosion and decreased its delamination.
It was also observed that the inhibition effect of GO-
U.D sheets became more prominent in the presence
of zinc cations. The chelation between the U.D mole-
cules and Zn species led to the deposition of a pro-
tective film on the active anodic and cathodic sites of
steel, and both electrochemical reactions were sup-
pressed. The corrosion-inhibiting effect of green cor-
rosion inhibitors (GIs) obtained from U.D leaves was

adsorbing on the mild steel surface and that their per-
formance boosts with concentration.[285] It was also
found that AAB-GO and DAB-GO act as mixed-type
inhibitors, behaving predominantly in a cathodic
manner. More recently, Sun and his team developed a
facile CVD method to modify graphene nanosheets
with molecular-sized polydimethylsiloxane.[269] The
synthesized nanostructures were used to reinforce
epoxy films, which displayed a coating resistance one

the coatings containing PAT/graphene
hybrids displayed excellent corrosion performance and
lower wear rate by dint of multifunctional graphene
and passive effect of PAT, which acted both as a cor-
rosion inhibitor and a lubricating agent.

Another strategy combining the passive barrier
property of graphene and active inhibition functional-
ity has been recently developed by Hou,[245] who pro-
posed graphene oxide nanocontainers as a promising
alternative to conventional capsule-based technologies,
whose barrier effect is limited due to their spherical
shape. The layer-by-layer
self-assembled GO-based
nanostructures, encapsulated with polymeric ionic

liquid (PIL), an environmentally friendly corrosion
inhibitor, endowed the resulting container-impreg-
nated epoxy composites with effective active inhibition
function and superior barrier properties. While the
embedded PIL could exert
its corrosion-inhibiting
effect at defected areas, the impermeable GO nano-
sheets provided passive protection by preventing the
penetration of corrosive species through the coating.

consequent formation of a dense metal oxide passive

the excellent cation exchange

The biomedical applications of graphene-based
materials have also attracted ever-increasing interest,
particularly
corrosion protection of metallic
implants, such as Ti and its alloys, which can be
deteriorated through wear and exposure to corrosive
environments.[286] In this context, graphene-reinforced
hydroxyapatite (HAp) biocomposites appear as a
potential solution.[287,288] The incorporation of such
materials as additives
in HAp hybrids has been
obtained through different approaches, namely bio-
mimetic mineralization,[289,290]
synthe-
sis,[291,292]

and radio-frequency chemical vapor

potential of electrodeposited graphene-based HAp
composites as improved protective schemes for Ti
substrates.[287,288,296] These novel coatings exhibit not
only enhanced mechanical performance and corrosion
stability when compared to pure HAp films, but also

Figure 10. Schematic illustration of the enhancement of the sacrificial anode protection in zinc-rich coatings by graphene through
increased percolation and the barrier effect.

Taking into consideration the fact that highly con-
ductive graphene can aggravate localized corrosion at
exposed metal-coating interfaces, several efforts have
been made to suppress its undesired corrosion-pro-
motion effect.[226,259,260,268] Contrarily, other authors
have taken advantage of such feature to mitigate cor-
rosion processes on metal surfaces by incorporating
graphene-based conductive additives in organic coat-
ings. Since the 1930s, zinc-rich coatings (ZRCs) have
been extensively utilized for a multiplicity of industrial
purposes under a wide range of hostile conditions.
Such systems are able to protect metal substrates in
the long term, even when slight mechanical damage
occurs. Whilst the polymer matrix serves as a barrier
toward corrosive agents, zinc particles provide cath-
odic protection by acting as sacrificial anodes. Given
the electron pathway established between those par-
ticles and the underlying metal, a galvanic cell
is
formed, wherein the substrate behaves as cathode.
Hence, the electron migration is suppressed, and cor-
rosion processes are inhibited or retarded. Epoxy

binders stand out amongst the most commonly used
binders for ZRCs by virtue of their remarkable mech-
anical and chemical resistance and high adhesive
strength. Since such film-forming elements possess
low electrical conductivity, a considerable load of zinc
particles is required to ensure electric continuity and
the occurrence of preferential galvanic corrosion of
zinc. However, an overload of zinc powder may
adversely affect the coating flexibility and adhesion to
the substrate, and eventually compromise its perform-
ance. For this reason, the protective mechanisms of
ZRCs strongly rely on the value of pigment volume
concentration. On the other hand, when this value is
lower than the critical pigment volume concentration,
the barrier effect prevails over cathodic protection. In
this regard, efforts have been made to enhance the
electrical conductivity of ZRCs without it being neces-
sary to increase the amount of zinc particles. An
attractive option involves the utilization of carbon-
based conductive fillers. The uniform distribution of

added in the proper amount. Several authors have
focused on the impact of graphene and its derivatives
on the corrosion resistance of ZRCs applied on
steel[297–302] and iron[303] surfaces. The incorporation
of graphene nanosheets into zinc-rich coatings can
significantly enhance the role of the sacrificial anode
(Figure 10). On one hand, the presence of graphene
provides electrical continuity between zinc particles
and the metallic substrate, thereby improving the per-
colation process with a lower amount of zinc pig-
ments as compared with traditional ZRCs. On the
other hand, graphene acts as a cathode and prevents
the electrolyte from further permeating through the
coating, seeking a cathodic counterpart for zinc pow-
der particles. The resulting insoluble, non-conductive
corrosion products effectively fill
the permeation
channel in the short term and, consequently, alleviate
the diffusion of aggressive agents. Thus, the protective
mechanism of zinc-rich epoxy coatings lies in the
combination of barrier properties
and cathodic
protection.[12]

5. Critical analysis

In the previous sections different methods for produc-
tion of graphene and graphene-based materials were
presented and their application in the field of corro-
sion protection were described. In this final section,
additional considerations are presented considering
two main points: the availability and quality of gra-
phene-based materials for the target application and
what can be done further in terms of characterization
to obtain additional
information on the devel-
oped systems.

5.1. Production method vs. application

The development of practical graphene-based anti-
corrosion solutions depends heavily on the ability to
produce this material in an economically viable fash-
ion, while possessing the required properties. For
anti-corrosion coatings based on graphene films, CVD
presents itself as the best option. Building on its abil-
ity to provide large area single- and few-layer gra-
phene, the recent progress in regard to CVD has led
to arbitrarily large films with a very low surface dens-
ity of grain boundaries. This allows to address one of
the main shortcomings of graphene film anti-corro-
sion coatings, which are the structural defects which
make the underlaying metal surface accessible to cor-
rosive species from the surrounding environment.

However, CVD growth is mostly limited to transition
metal substrates, most often in the form of a foil or a
thin sheet. This limits its direct growth on other met-
als. A number of approaches to transfer graphene
from the original transition metal to the desired sub-
strate exist, but these tend to be rather laborious and
incompatible with target substrates possessing a non-
planar geometry, not to mention the associated con-
cern of introducing cracks, tears and wrinkles in the
graphene during the process. These would defeat the
purpose of graphene as an impermeable barrier to the
corrosive species.

As composite coatings with graphene are concerned,
the most viable options seem to be the different types of
high-throughput exfoliation. High shear stress exfoliation,
for example, benefits from dispensing the use of interca-
lating agents, while requiring considerably less time to
achieve the same amount of FLG as through sonication,
also avoiding the introduction of basal plane defects
often seen after ball milling. Electrochemical exfoliation
has also seen a lot of progress and is perhaps one of the
more easily scalable exfoliation techniques. However, all
these approaches share some common shortcomings.
The thickness (number of graphene layers) and the lat-
eral dimensions of the obtained flakes are often hard to
control. Besides, the use of appropriate solvents is usually
required, either during or after the process, to aid in the
exfoliation and to avoid re-aggregation, with the best
suited
hazardous.
Environmentally friendly alternatives are available, but
further research is needed. One should also note that
these exfoliation approaches are also adequate for anti-
corrosion solutions based on non-composite coatings
formed from graphene flake suspensions.

Composite coatings containing graphene-based mate-
rials such as GO or rGO, on the other hand, continue to
rely on the Hummers method and its variations as the
most commonly employed production approach. This
type of material is particularly relevant when functionali-
zation is required, as happens in the cases where the dis-
persibility of the graphene-based material in a polymeric
matrix needs to be improved. There, GOs and rGOs
benefit from the presence of oxygen containing groups
on their surface. And even then, vigorous mechanical
dispersion strategies need to be implemented.

This underlines one of the main issues concerning
composite anti-corrosion coatings with graphene and
graphene-based materials: the need for functionaliza-
tion, particularly with the aim of improving its disper-
sibility in polymeric matrices. In this context, both
covalent and non-covalent modification approaches
have delivered some promising results, as have the

immobilization. It
is worth pointing out, however,
that most of these approaches use graphene oxide as
the starting point, leaving plenty of room for further
work in the development of reliable functionalization
techniques of pristine graphene flakes.

field matches

One should also be aware that,

independently of
the type of the anti-corrosion coating, it is important
that any future work in this
the
employed graphene or graphene-based material to the
role and characteristics that are expected from it, as
there is a number of works which ascribe the proper-
ties of pristine graphene to other graphene-based
materials, such as GO. Both categories of materials
have a place in the field of anti-corrosion technology,
but the requirements for each one of them can vary
greatly. While certain applications may require, for
example, an easily attainable functionalization of the
graphene-based material, and, thus, the presence of
oxygen containing groups can be beneficial, others
can demand sufficient electrical conductivity, as in the
case of zinc-rich coatings, where pristine graphene
flakes may result in better anti-corrosion performance.

5.2. Challenges and guidelines for characterization

of anti-corrosion coatings using graphene

As described in sections 3 and 4, the contact between
the graphene film and the metal substrate is of utmost
importance for a long-lasting corrosion resistance. To
achieve a maximal barrier effect under relevant service
life conditions, a high-quality graphene film should
fully cover the metal surface, despite their rough sur-
faces or curved shapes, while making it difficult for
reactive agents such as oxygen and water to reach the
metal surface. Therefore, a good adhesion between the
graphene or graphene-based coating and the substrate,
with high resistivity of this coating to wear and fric-
tion, is highly desirable.

standardized methods

The industry employs

to
evaluate adhesion between coatings and substrates. As
an example, the cross-cut tape test ASTM D3359 is
widely used for ranking adhesion properties of coat-
ings. Some works available in the literature have used
this method to prove that organic coatings do not lose
adhesion to the substrate upon modification by gra-
phene-based materials.[304,305] Furthermore, evaluation
of adhesion in laboratories is often carried out using
pull-off
tests following the ASTM D4541 standard.
Parhizkar et al.[279,280] applied a pull-off method for
testing adhesion properties of epoxy coatings depos-
ited on the samples coated with a functionalized GO

film, with sol-gel coatings containing GO additives or
functionalized GO having been used for adhesion pro-
motion between the metal and the epoxy coating. The
results demonstrated an improvement
in adhesion
strength of the coating systems containing GO modi-
fied with 3-(triethoxysilyl) propyl
isocyanate and
APTES silanes. These systems demonstrated cohesion
failure at
the modified GO-coating/epoxy interface,
unlike the simple unmodified GO/epoxy system. This
effect was attributed to NH2 and NCO functional
groups present in the modified GO that can create
strong covalent bonding with the top epoxy coating.

Overall,

in the

circumstances where

adhesion
strength is in demand or may be compromised by the
additives used in coating systems, an appropriate test-
ing should be performed. Adhesion tests can reveal at
which interface the adhesive failure occurs, thus indi-
cating a potentially weak spot in the coating system.
Proper measures can be developed afterwards in order
to curb the weakness.

Another aspect lacking extensive coverage in the lit-
erature so far is the detailed analysis of diffusion in coat-
ings modified with graphene and graphene-derived
materials. Most of the works on coatings modified with
graphene and its derivatives claim that the aforemen-
tioned additives offer protection against diffusion of cor-
rosive species through the coating. In fact, methods such
as EIS have been used for characterization of coated met-
als for decades. Impedance spectra taken from samples
under immersion in different electrolytes contain valuable
information concerning the properties of metal/polymer
and metal/solution interfaces, as well as other properties
of the coatings. Using an appropriate equivalent circuit
model allows to extract different parameters and assess
evolution of parameters in time. The capacitance of a
coating can be easily extracted from impedance spec-
tra,[306] and it depends on surface area, thickness and the
dielectric constant of the coating. Moreover, the swelling
of the coating can have an impact on the capacitance of
the coating during immersion, as the latter will depend
on the amount of water absorbed, due to it having a
much larger dielectric constant than an organic coat-
ing.[307] A quantitative representation of water uptake by
a coating was provided by the Brasher and Kingsbury
equation,[308] which correlates water uptake to the coat-
ing’s capacitance. Considering diffusion to be the main
driving force for the water absorption, a particular solu-
tion of Fick’s second law allows to obtain the diffusion
coefficient.[309] Upon combining
and
Kingsbury equation with the solution of Fick’s second
law a new equation is derived. It displays a linear
dependence between the capacitance and the square root

of time during a short time of immersion when water
uptake follows the fickian diffusion. Diffusion coefficient
of water is obtained from the slope of that dependence.
Such an approach may be used to characterize organic
coating systems containing graphene and its derivatives.
However, this analysis is very demanding and requires
careful impedance measurements and selection of correct
equivalent
of
EIS spectra.

In conclusion, like with any other type of material
under scrutiny for industrial implementation, it is evi-
dent
the only
existing solution to address all the technological chal-
lenges in the field of protective coatings, especially in
cases where more cost-effective additives exist and
give similar performances.

However, it is undeniable that the studies available in
the literature so far point to unique properties rendered
by graphene and its derivatives which, together with the
implementation of industrial processes to produce suffi-
cient amounts of
these nanostructured materials, will
contribute to the generation of new solutions for corro-
sion protection in the forthcoming years.
